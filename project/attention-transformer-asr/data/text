sw02001-A_001980-002131 um-hum
sw02001-A_002736-002893 and is
sw02001-A_003390-004012 right right is there is there um an- is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask
sw02001-A_004012-004155 right
sw02001-A_005013-005157 [noise] right
sw02001-A_005696-006559 right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like [noise] depending on what you think you'll be doing that day
sw02001-A_006960-007110 right
sw02001-A_007332-007541 yes [laughter]
sw02001-A_007642-008004 yeah yeah well i- i- that's right and it
sw02001-A_008143-009209 yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i- in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but [noise]
sw02001-A_009209-010507 um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you [noise]
sw02001-A_010507-011205 uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you [noise] um
sw02001-A_011205-012636 uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i- i'm not i'm not there but [laughter] but anyway
sw02001-A_012636-013746 um and seaso- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if it's hot out but um
sw02001-A_013912-014093 that's
sw02001-A_014093-015333 that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety m- maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the
sw02001-A_015333-016204 the men often have to wear shirt and tie no matter r- right right what time of what time of the year that's right
sw02001-A_016204-017698 that's that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those tha- [noise] not reall-

sw02001-A_020589-021592 yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th- they were much there was much more casual dress although i don't think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing
sw02001-A_021592-021750 right
sw02001-A_021968-022242 that's that's right
sw02001-A_022822-022968 yeah
sw02001-A_022968-023169 yeah and
sw02001-A_023169-023361 that's right

sw02001-B_002281-002695 we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often
sw02001-B_002695-003481 so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature
sw02001-B_003481-003609 so
sw02001-B_003856-004079 [noise] not formally
sw02001-B_004079-005076 but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like jerry junkins' office and bill ellsworth's office to deliver stuff
sw02001-B_005076-005889 and we prepare a lot of foils for marvin and bill so [noise] we have to dress a little bit nice we're not [noise]
sw02001-B_006418-007105 yes now you know if if every- like in august when everybody's on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or
sw02001-B_007105-007875 ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but [laughter] i guess that would have to do with the weather but um
sw02001-B_007875-008223 unless it's an ex- you know an unusual day
sw02001-B_008700-008881 um-hum
sw02001-B_009752-009912 yeah
sw02001-B_010081-010244 um-hum
sw02001-B_010416-010604 right

sw02001-B_011787-011936 okay
sw02001-B_012294-012658 [laughter]
sw02001-B_013100-013300 it with the
sw02001-B_013300-013480 yeah
sw02001-B_013633-014205 but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because the air conditioner's doing its job so well [noise]
sw02001-B_015002-015203 oh yeah
sw02001-B_015407-015534 it
sw02001-B_015534-016624 uh-huh just suits and there's not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they can't have a rayon suit [laughter] so
sw02001-B_017439-018352 not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway [noise]
sw02001-B_018352-018859 uh most of the women wear uh m- actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else
sw02001-B_018859-019609 but i'm not in that professional of a position [noise] so i don't i'm not expected to do that
sw02001-B_020119-020272 um-hum
sw02001-B_020377-020731 [noise] yes pretty much i'm a secretary [noise] yeah
sw02001-B_021347-022588 y- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't know i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear
sw02001-B_022588-023005 it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine
sw02001-B_023005-023547 you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much
sw02001-B_023787-024544 [noise] well that pretty much covers the subject [laughter] well thanks for calling me
sw02001-B_024693-025106 yep that's all good-bye okay bye
sw02001-B_025106-025230 [noise]
sw02005-A_000000-001129 okay uh first um i need to know uh h- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
sw02005-A_002098-002297 yes yeah
sw02005-A_003124-003295 um-hum
sw02005-A_004448-004644 yes
sw02005-A_007744-007900 yeah
sw02005-A_008598-008747 yeah
sw02005-A_009797-011224 um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um
sw02005-A_011224-012570 she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh parkinson's disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house sh- then she lived in an apartment and um
sw02005-A_012570-013151 that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of
sw02005-A_013151-014524 change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she tr- she had she had children all across the united states and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
sw02005-A_014524-015586 and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
sw02005-A_015586-016068 yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh
sw02005-A_016068-017397 not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think
sw02005-A_017397-018529 yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision
sw02005-A_018529-019798 than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family
sw02005-A_019798-020900 getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
sw02005-A_020900-022128 finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home
sw02005-A_022128-023544 and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hard- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
sw02005-A_024247-024649 yeah yeah well we we yeah
sw02005-A_024973-025068 um-hum
sw02005-A_026045-026173 yeah
sw02005-A_027069-027221 um-hum
sw02005-A_028260-029014 yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with
sw02005-A_029022-030062 she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday
sw02005-A_030062-030741 and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
sw02005-A_030741-031284 um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her
sw02005-A_031284-032543 and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i di- i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating
sw02005-A_032543-032748 and um
sw02005-A_032748-033418 i i th- i think that what one thing that w- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact
sw02005-A_033418-034423 it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very
sw02005-A_034423-035465 were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the
sw02005-A_035465-036098 what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question
sw02005-A_036525-036685 yeah
sw02005-A_036685-036798 yeah
sw02005-A_036928-037534 yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the united states is changing because
sw02005-A_037534-038131 you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
sw02005-A_038131-039078 um i- matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation
sw02005-A_039078-040123 we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
sw02005-A_040123-040271 uh
sw02005-A_040395-040849 yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family
sw02005-A_040849-041743 you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e- e- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not
sw02005-A_041743-042695 any of the grandparents would we feel they're gonna be a good [laughter] they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all
sw02005-A_042943-043973 yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people
sw02005-A_043973-044645 especially where they've had uh extended family and i and an- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps
sw02005-A_044645-045448 you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's
sw02005-A_045448-046398 money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be
sw02005-A_046398-047597 you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean [noise] i mean we may not we may not have as [noise] high a standard of living but
sw02005-A_047597-048024 the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living
sw02005-A_048175-048349 yeah yeah
sw02005-A_048349-048484 yeah
sw02005-A_048484-048552 [noise]
sw02005-A_048552-048784 okay well
sw02005-A_048784-049053 i guess that was it [laughter]
sw02005-A_049053-049105 [noise]
sw02005-A_049105-049477 okay all right hey bye-bye
sw02005-A_049477-049882 [noise]
sw02005-B_001044-002168 well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know f- and for their uh you know for their own good
sw02005-B_002168-003255 i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh
sw02005-B_003255-003549 uh s- eight months ago i guess
sw02005-B_003549-003847 and uh we were i was fortunate in that
sw02005-B_003847-004526 i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown
sw02005-B_004526-005645 so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who
sw02005-B_005645-006595 had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh
sw02005-B_006595-007149 it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
sw02005-B_007149-007450 and it was really not not very good uh
sw02005-B_007450-007767 deal we were not really happy with the
sw02005-B_007767-008400 nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again
sw02005-B_008400-008827 but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it
sw02005-B_008827-010042 you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns
sw02005-B_010751-010948 um-hum
sw02005-B_011702-011849 hm

sw02005-B_023501-023799 absolutely un- unfortunately at a lot of times it
sw02005-B_023799-024351 responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know
sw02005-B_024351-025011 and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh l- [vocalized-noise] i was lucky too that i only have m- one brother
sw02005-B_025011-025560 and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done
sw02005-B_025560-026258 my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three
sw02005-B_026258-027115 we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on
sw02005-B_027115-028296 that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us

sw02006-A_003483-004729 and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that t._i. has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a
sw02006-A_004729-006027 a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such
sw02006-A_006027-007306 but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants
sw02006-A_007306-008259 from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have
sw02006-A_008259-009051 uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air
sw02006-A_009632-009782 oh okay
sw02006-A_010190-010390 oh [laughter]
sw02006-A_011275-011405 uh-huh
sw02006-A_012499-012639 um-hum
sw02006-A_013352-013491 uh-huh
sw02006-A_013720-013867 okay
sw02006-A_015908-016039 um-hum
sw02006-A_018303-018447 hm
sw02006-A_018986-019117 hm
sw02006-A_019512-019854 now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it
sw02006-A_020955-021080 hm
sw02006-A_021739-021868 um-hum
sw02006-A_022223-022369 um-hum
sw02006-A_023876-024013 right
sw02006-A_026239-026525 [laughter]
sw02006-A_026648-027327 well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and
sw02006-A_027327-028206 you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not
sw02006-A_028206-029178 uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh
sw02006-A_029178-029809 you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um
sw02006-A_029809-031188 certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know i- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
sw02006-A_031188-031517 it still only in time starts to leak out
sw02006-A_031517-032019 yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again
sw02006-A_032019-032495 [laughter] jeez [laughter]
sw02006-A_033455-033584 um-hum
sw02006-A_034552-034688 um-hum
sw02006-A_035761-035890 hm
sw02006-A_036239-036397 um-hum
sw02006-A_038830-038977 yeah
sw02006-A_039524-039831 oh you were oh okay
sw02006-A_039954-040090 yes
sw02006-A_040090-041523 yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean w- we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know t._i. that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen years [laughter]
sw02006-A_042094-042793 [laughter] we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before
sw02006-A_042793-042876 [laughter]
sw02006-A_043167-043581 right right not just overhead [laughter]
sw02006-A_043581-043841 you too bye
sw02006-A_043841-043996 [noise]
sw02006-B_000000-000068 [noise]
sw02006-B_000068-001132 alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
sw02006-B_001132-001684 as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
sw02006-B_001684-001830 um
sw02006-B_001830-001917 [noise]
sw02006-B_001917-002452 does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines
sw02006-B_003401-003530 um-hum
sw02006-B_006654-006796 very
sw02006-B_009015-010010 yeah it's uh having uh uh w- well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the sherman deal is uh uh uh
sw02006-B_010010-011319 [laughter] lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the texas air control board t._a._c._b. that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
sw02006-B_011319-012559 and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the t._a._c._b. which is located in austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at t._i.
sw02006-B_012559-013218 and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um
sw02006-B_013218-014067 uh this is air side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in tons per year um
sw02006-B_014067-014970 and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems
sw02006-B_014970-015790 uh that uh scrub out the n._o._x. and uh v._o._c.s and and the ammonia compounds uh li- all the acids
sw02006-B_015790-017135 uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts
sw02006-B_017135-018383 and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto
sw02006-B_018383-019582 as you know the they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
sw02006-B_019800-020172 the sherman facility we are still in the
sw02006-B_020172-021415 closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the sherman uh city council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh
sw02006-B_021415-021803 uh tom jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project
sw02006-B_021803-022468 and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it
sw02006-B_022468-023335 uh but it's uh it's something else yeah tha- they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh
sw02006-B_023335-024322 because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh
sw02006-B_024322-025381 any bad stuff so uh i think t._i. we spend o- o- of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh
sw02006-B_025381-026433 uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh
sw02006-B_026433-026715 it's an interesting job but um
sw02006-B_031443-031584 possibly
sw02006-B_031584-031705 hm
sw02006-B_032112-032355 uh i'm familiar with that one
sw02006-B_032355-032752 we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah
sw02006-B_032752-034039 we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it
sw02006-B_034039-035177 and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground
sw02006-B_035177-035834 but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
sw02006-B_035834-037085 which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh
sw02006-B_037085-038484 expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would
sw02006-B_038484-038588 um
sw02006-B_038588-038689 [noise]
sw02006-B_038689-038875 i've enjoyed speaking with you
sw02006-B_038875-039725 this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building [laughter] yeah
sw02006-B_039725-040371 so uh i hope you like your office [laughter]
sw02006-B_040600-040718 yeah
sw02006-B_041269-042142 yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all w- y'all the only ones that make any money for t._i. here in the last two years
sw02006-B_042142-042296 [laughter]
sw02006-B_042296-042432 [laughter] s-

sw02007-A_000000-000095 [noise]
sw02007-A_000095-000550 well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution
sw02007-A_001194-001913 yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then there's like you say there's industry
sw02007-A_001913-002436 with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere
sw02007-A_002436-002746 causing acid rain and everything else
sw02007-A_003343-003471 hm
sw02007-A_003600-003933 ozone yeah ozo- ozone pollution yeah
sw02007-A_004299-005253 well i was i was thinking about that too i mean uh we don't have any suitable replacement for freon and y- and you have to have it for refrigeration so
sw02007-A_005253-005511 but on the other hand you know i i've
sw02007-A_005511-006179 um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane
sw02007-A_006179-006628 i- it was actually powered by a flame
sw02007-A_006941-007473 yeah uh it it something with heat i don't understand the mechanics of it but uh
sw02007-A_007688-007830 um-hum
sw02007-A_008294-008429 um-hum
sw02007-A_010368-010686 oh okay so it still had freon in it
sw02007-A_010686-010912 oh okay i well li-
sw02007-A_011057-011207 yeah
sw02007-A_011207-011357 yeah
sw02007-A_011893-012387 right which happens all the time when they go to service the things
sw02007-A_013012-013106 um-hum
sw02007-A_013247-013445 yeah escape
sw02007-A_013445-013779 sure yeah yeah i
sw02007-A_015954-016158 hm well that makes sense
sw02007-A_016158-016975 i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and
sw02007-A_016975-017610 all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the canadians on the acid rain problem
sw02007-A_017610-018021 but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that [laughter]
sw02007-A_018021-018227 we we can't clean it up
sw02007-A_018378-018521 [noise]

sw02007-A_020941-021082 yeah
sw02007-A_021082-021646 yeah yeah that's right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing it's uh
sw02007-A_021646-022420 i- i don't kn- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate everyday
sw02007-A_022420-023244 and i just have a feeling that that you know that's our s- that's our air scrubbing stuff there and they're they're taking away the sponge
sw02007-A_023416-023651 i don't know this uh
sw02007-A_023651-023824 ozone

sw02007-A_031924-032144 go- well it's
sw02007-A_033077-033277 yeah right the
sw02007-A_033277-033616 the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff
sw02007-A_033616-033781 [noise]
sw02007-A_033781-034074 jeez well that's scary
sw02007-A_034074-034650 i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because you never know what's gonna come out
sw02007-A_034650-035354 you kn- [laughter] and i and i don- i don't really trust these these government agencies that test this stuff i really don't
sw02007-A_036718-037443 yeah well it's it's like so many o- it's like chicken you know they go in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken
sw02007-A_037443-037939 i don't know if you ever saw that 60 minutes thing where they showed a chicken processing plant
sw02007-A_037939-038288 yeah i i haven't touched chicken since
sw02007-A_038288-038812 yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that
sw02007-A_038812-039105 and but the government says it's safe uh-huh
sw02007-A_039105-039616 right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country
sw02007-A_039616-040461 and they s- s- -eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like los angeles is s- still so thick you have to cut it with a knife
sw02007-A_040461-040618 i don't know
sw02007-A_041125-041360 just about yeah
sw02007-A_041360-041977 yeah um i don't know you know used to be a lot of states had uh
sw02007-A_041977-042710 uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to have that little sticker in the window i know texas does
sw02007-A_042710-043109 and there are about three places in georgia that does
sw02007-A_043109-043644 and i think louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of them around anymore
sw02007-A_044176-044439 yeah they don't do it anymore
sw02007-A_044439-044584 yeah
sw02007-A_044929-045046 um-hum
sw02007-A_045046-045813 i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about having to pay that fee a-
sw02007-A_045813-046214 yeah a- and i mean all it was was a revenue generator
sw02007-A_046214-046588 i- it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve
sw02007-A_046588-047380 i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching huge blue clouds of oil smoke
sw02007-A_047380-047807 and you tell me that guy passed a pollution test you know
sw02007-A_048102-048282 [noise]
sw02007-A_048282-048536 oh yeah oh those are
sw02007-A_048536-049249 yeah i mea- you know what was it back in the uh late seventies when diesel engines were the thing
sw02007-A_049249-049679 because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's
sw02007-A_049679-050130 what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is o- you know one oh five
sw02007-A_050653-051120 i never did like diesels anyway they they were too cantankerous
sw02007-A_051120-051293 cold w-
sw02007-A_051601-051753 um
sw02007-A_051753-052421 yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a buick had had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing
sw02007-A_052421-052850 yeah winter time the the diesel would gel and it wouldn't
sw02007-A_052850-053465 i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh go-
sw02007-A_054826-054961 um-hum
sw02007-A_056493-056617 yeah
sw02007-A_056719-057208 that that may that yeah that may have been what he had um
sw02007-A_057208-057784 but speaking of cars [noise] what more can we do to cars to make them less polluting
sw02007-A_058205-058342 yeah
sw02007-A_059416-059797 i'm just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars
sw02007-A_059797-059982 i saw an article in the pap-
sw02007-B_000000-000066 [noise]
sw02007-B_000467-001257 well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes uh quite a bit to air pollution
sw02007-B_002684-003437 uh y- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh freon is uh is uh eating away at our
sw02007-B_003437-003830 uh what you call that layer there ozone layer
sw02007-B_003945-004433 i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro- in place of freon
sw02007-B_005294-005515 [vocalized-noise]
sw02007-B_006553-006976 uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works
sw02007-B_007347-007752 well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat
sw02007-B_007752-008361 be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said
sw02007-B_008361-009047 uh you had and uh somehow cr- heat must be created that freon
sw02007-B_009047-009579 oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and
sw02007-B_009579-010386 in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes fr- c- uh ice cold
sw02007-B_010620-011108 oh yes yes freon's uh freon is in a closed circuit
sw02007-B_011215-011951 uh that's why our present day refrigerants uh systems are not dangerous unless the lines are broken
sw02007-B_012342-013082 w- well did you ever see what happens when they uh replace the or replenish the freon in your automobile air conditioner
sw02007-B_013082-013626 i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere
sw02007-B_013626-014415 and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in texas or what but uh
sw02007-B_014415-014904 service stations are going to require to have a special device
sw02007-B_014904-015412 to catch this freon as it is ex- expelled the excess freon
sw02007-B_015412-016015 and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home
sw02007-B_017965-018119 no that's true
sw02007-B_018220-018536 you know i can remember as a child uh
sw02007-B_018536-019050 spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit
sw02007-B_019050-019316 no shoes socks shirts or anything
sw02007-B_019316-019598 uh i mean from dawn till dusk
sw02007-B_019598-020242 and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it never had to worry about uh skin cancer
sw02007-B_020347-020974 or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and and get a drink of water without worrying a-
sw02007-B_020974-021223 about catching some disease
sw02007-B_023208-023384 hm yeah yeah
sw02007-B_023687-024116 i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water
sw02007-B_024116-024858 uh t._i. sent me up on a trip to wyoming i think it was and i was out in this little
sw02007-B_024858-025582 town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is going down watching the traffic light change
sw02007-B_025683-025993 but uh i checked into a motel
sw02007-B_025993-026552 and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't drink the water
sw02007-B_026552-026746 it's contaminated
sw02007-B_026746-027530 he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately we're out of it right now but as as soon as we get it
sw02007-B_027530-027783 i- i'll see that you get a bottle of it
sw02007-B_027783-028465 well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it i brushed my teeth with coca-cola
sw02007-B_028589-028696 [laughter]
sw02007-B_029062-029329 oh well th- they had this uh
sw02007-B_029436-029890 it's uh some kind of a bacteria call- or carried by animals
sw02007-B_029890-030400 and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river
sw02007-B_030400-030783 well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream
sw02007-B_030783-031300 but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire
sw02007-B_031300-031577 pipe system or water system
sw02007-B_031577-031998 and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it
sw02007-B_031998-032656 i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever did course the oh was a beautiful mountain stream
sw02007-B_032656-033248 bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles
sw02007-B_033459-033830 yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated
sw02007-B_034615-034937 yeah yes
sw02007-B_035366-035956 well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you g- you're always hearing stories about well the government okayed this
sw02007-B_035956-036149 then all of a sudden you turn around and
sw02007-B_036149-036798 my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way it's dangerous
sw02007-B_037824-038015 as a matter of fact i did
sw02007-B_038213-038331 neither have i
sw02007-B_038331-038439 [laughter]
sw02007-B_038979-039201 uh yeah
sw02007-B_040663-041288 i've often wondered about the l._a. now that's supposed to be about the worst c- city in the country i guess for
sw02007-B_041288-041423 air pollution
sw02007-B_042668-042852 uh yeah um-hum
sw02007-B_043679-043801 well
sw02007-B_043801-044296 uh they used to do it down in florida now i lived down there for ten years
sw02007-B_044296-044719 no they did away with it because they found out that uh
sw02007-B_044719-045046 the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them
sw02007-B_045656-045959 and for n- uh for nothing [vocalized-noise] too
sw02007-B_046139-046287 yeah
sw02007-B_047596-047977 um-hum well now here's another thing diesels
sw02007-B_047977-048358 uh diesel engines are uh the worst
sw02007-B_048358-048610 and yet they haven't done a thing to them
sw02007-B_050086-050607 uh-huh yeah t- t- tell me about it i just got rid of a a diesel engine escort
sw02007-B_051151-051778 well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago
sw02007-B_052345-052544 is that right well
sw02007-B_053332-053755 uh-huh well now there was at one time
sw02007-B_053755-054295 as a matter of fact it may have been buick i think because i think it was g._m. that came out with a
sw02007-B_054397-054890 disea- uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine
sw02007-B_054890-055486 and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the uh
sw02007-B_055486-056008 uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over
sw02007-B_056008-056570 and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a headache
sw02007-B_056570-056926 and they did aw- w- t- we- finally did away with them and went to a straight diesel
sw02007-B_057735-058313 well now course in california they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere
sw02007-B_058313-058742 now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in california
sw02007-B_058742-059210 i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something
sw02007-B_059210-059407 a little more stricter than we do

sw02010-A_001856-002057 no i haven't
sw02010-A_002057-002726 um i've visited the wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where dances with wolves was filmed
sw02010-A_002947-003284 could be i- i haven't been to south dakota
sw02010-A_003284-003530 ha- have you been up to that
sw02010-A_003530-003827 oh okay
sw02010-A_003931-004091 terrain
sw02010-A_004611-004750 really
sw02010-A_005106-006570 that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody
sw02010-A_007090-007231 uh-huh
sw02010-A_007441-007559 right
sw02010-A_008122-008248 did you
sw02010-A_008248-008509 have you seen sleeping with the enemy
sw02010-A_008721-009174 y- you have to go see that one and how about silence of the lambs go
sw02010-A_009174-009951 i do i go every weekend i- i uh those are two definite must see movies i think
sw02010-A_010359-010483 [noise]
sw02010-A_010483-011311 it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t- i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense
sw02010-A_011311-012561 um [noise] the other one silence of the lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies
sw02010-A_012665-012827 no huh-uh
sw02010-A_012933-013293 yeah somebody in south carolina told me about him
sw02010-A_013716-013848 yeah
sw02010-A_015771-015905 oh
sw02010-A_016540-016659 uh-huh
sw02010-A_018351-019289 i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d- i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do
sw02010-A_019289-020140 he wanted to direct it he wanted to a- to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really w- he really wanted it whether it
sw02010-A_020140-020758 whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because
sw02010-A_020758-021619 i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
sw02010-A_022095-022267 um
sw02010-A_022576-022931 yeah who no i don't know who that guy is
sw02010-A_023043-023215 oh he does
sw02010-A_023215-023524 as a recurring character every week
sw02010-A_023524-024077 [noise] oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together
sw02010-A_024382-024536 huh-uh
sw02010-A_024955-025096 yeah
sw02010-A_025203-025570 yeah real scruffy looking [laughter]
sw02010-A_026199-026375 yeah
sw02010-A_026720-027127 you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um
sw02010-A_027127-028879 [noise]
sw02010-B_000000-000192 this is archie
sw02010-B_000308-000539 have you seen dancing with wolf
sw02010-B_001676-001961 have you ever lived in that part of the country
sw02010-B_001961-002156 have you ever visited it
sw02010-B_002653-003045 i think it was the black hills of south dakota
sw02010-B_003407-004004 well i lived in omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh
sw02010-B_004004-004695 yeah is is fairly fami- the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's gonna win everything
sw02010-B_004695-005293 uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of
sw02010-B_006442-007507 well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story
sw02010-B_007507-008297 and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah
sw02010-B_008404-008819 no i've heard i've heard that's really great though
sw02010-B_008977-009264 no you must really keep up
sw02010-B_009838-010567 we- isn't isn't sleeping with the enemy isn't that a i- is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful
sw02010-B_012460-012985 do you do you listen to gary cohill cohi- is uh you know who he is
sw02010-B_013178-013797 he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic -n channel eight in dallas
sw02010-B_013797-014286 and he does uh he has a talk show on the
sw02010-B_014286-015495 k._l._i._f. anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting there's a certain amount of drivel that they do they've got uh they've got a couple of kids
sw02010-B_015495-015882 ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's uh
sw02010-B_015882-016763 he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening sunday night a little bit when i was uh going to
sw02010-B_016763-017892 pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh i- the it it's interesting though the the the difficulty with with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it
sw02010-B_017892-018425 uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it
sw02010-B_021561-022101 do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver
sw02010-B_022101-022607 a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post
sw02010-B_022805-023123 he he plays on murphy brown
sw02010-B_023123-023351 yes he's
sw02010-B_023351-023668 he's eldon her housepainter
sw02010-B_023668-023887 do you believe that
sw02010-B_024032-025022 that's [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it's really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a
sw02010-B_025022-025312 you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh
sw02010-B_025312-026268 yeah real scruffy looking and it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie but i thought it's good that you know it was a lot of fun
sw02010-B_026268-026809 i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes i should think we've done enough
sw02010-B_027434-027803 well i don't know wh- how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up
sw02010-B_028179-028670 why don't we do that good-bye sharon [noise]
sw02012-A_000000-000297 [noise]
sw02012-A_000297-001032 well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um
sw02012-A_001032-001867 if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's
sw02012-A_001867-003199 one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of
sw02012-A_003199-004322 invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh
sw02012-A_004322-004825 finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh
sw02012-A_004825-005444 um obviously everyday
sw02012-A_006570-006872 that's right
sw02012-A_007376-007543 uh-huh
sw02012-A_007975-008397 right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation [noise]
sw02012-A_009763-010470 from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer- phone uh commercial things
sw02012-A_010470-011646 oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever [laughter] um
sw02012-A_011646-012142 because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are
sw02012-A_012142-012384 i think they prey on people's um
sw02012-A_012384-013773 inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
sw02012-A_014297-014467 um-hum
sw02012-A_014721-014915 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_015249-015448 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_016177-016350 yeah
sw02012-A_017146-018012 well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic
sw02012-A_018012-018757 oh i don't know c._i._a. conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's
sw02012-A_018757-019126 things that invade that second type of privacy
sw02012-A_019126-019724 where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and
sw02012-A_019724-021078 i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia [laughter] yeah to surmise and i'd like to think that's it's quite low at least in this country i don't feel like the k._g._b. is monitoring my phone or anything like that
sw02012-A_021598-021838 um-hum yeah
sw02012-A_022549-022911 um-hum um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_023666-023943 um-hum um-hum [noise]
sw02012-A_025102-025600 um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then [laughter]
sw02012-A_026465-026949 yes yes you'd b- more harmed or something yeah
sw02012-A_027282-027767 yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it
sw02012-A_028700-028900 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_029661-029885 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_030398-030577 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_030979-031327 [laughter] they had you pegged [laughter]
sw02012-A_031327-031530 [laughter]
sw02012-A_031530-031632 yeah
sw02012-A_031632-031722 [laughter]
sw02012-A_031722-031881 yeah
sw02012-A_031881-033050 yeah and i one of the problems with the lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but
sw02012-A_033050-034171 uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that [laughter] it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering
sw02012-A_034171-035100 you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having
sw02012-A_035100-035725 virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and
sw02012-A_035725-036700 and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home
sw02012-A_037078-037224 yeah
sw02012-A_037224-037441 yes exactly
sw02012-A_037684-038414 um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing
sw02012-A_038414-039073 that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
sw02012-A_039073-040467 but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and
sw02012-A_040467-040706 i realize that that i mean
sw02012-A_040706-041096 i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in india and
sw02012-A_041096-042500 things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
sw02012-A_042627-043164 yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially [noise]
sw02012-A_043164-044146 um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because it's in your way you people walk in and out and
sw02012-A_044146-044823 as a as a westerner in india i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
sw02012-A_044823-045500 you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
sw02012-A_045500-045717 and people would leave me alone
sw02012-A_045717-046862 whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia- of um public behavior um
sw02012-A_046862-047979 people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it
sw02012-A_047979-048574 but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
sw02012-A_048574-049499 and which isn't al- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now th- i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
sw02012-A_050131-050319 um-hum um-hum
sw02012-A_050319-051796 and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that i mean they o- [laughter] you go to india and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years um but i i just don't quite
sw02012-A_051796-051939 um
sw02012-A_051939-053266 there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
sw02012-A_053266-053831 because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that
sw02012-A_053831-054995 there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re- will respect and if that's gone um i i r- really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that
sw02012-A_056048-056917 well the class- the other classic examples the jehovah's witness or or mormons or someone knocking at the front door um
sw02012-A_056917-057796 which is more intrusive because i have to f- really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see
sw02012-A_057796-058650 what i look like what i live like and norm- and they're doing something that normally i really only invite people to because i
sw02012-A_058650-059551 any f- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion
sw02012-A_059551-059776 [noise]
sw02012-B_005094-005596 i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the
sw02012-B_005596-006666 typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's t._i. calling my immediate reaction is th- -t's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited
sw02012-B_006666-008014 so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a si- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
sw02012-B_008221-008861 exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of
sw02012-B_008861-009948 uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
sw02012-B_010176-010629 commercial soli- solicitations primarily
sw02012-B_011949-012122 yeah
sw02012-B_013597-014780 and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
sw02012-B_014780-015323 and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me
sw02012-B_015323-015653 um i guess i'm not
sw02012-B_015653-016187 typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second
sw02012-B_016187-017326 thi- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information
sw02012-B_019950-020307 to s- to surmise it is there
sw02012-B_020307-020948 [vocalized-noise]
sw02012-B_020948-021222 well i guess although
sw02012-B_021222-022704 i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
sw02012-B_022704-023738 um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it
sw02012-B_023738-025139 i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that
sw02012-B_025298-026486 [laughter] uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s- there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
sw02012-B_026701-027406 bec- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off the- did you hear about this lotus database that was being put together
sw02012-B_027654-028728 that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be cou- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy
sw02012-B_028728-030194 and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate
sw02012-B_030194-031149 incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because [laughter] uh someone had had [vocalized-noise]
sw02012-B_031149-032012 right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly
sw02012-B_033464-033680 right right
sw02012-B_034260-034422 right
sw02012-B_036451-036602 um-hum
sw02012-B_036602-037673 and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so s- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is
sw02012-B_040152-040319 um-hum
sw02012-B_041799-042028 oh that's interesting
sw02012-B_042250-042630 but but no concept for wanting to be private
sw02012-B_043019-043177 okay
sw02012-B_044164-044500 oh th- that would be
sw02012-B_044619-044927 that'd be culturally shocking
sw02012-B_045381-045558 uh-huh
sw02012-B_045558-045736 uh-huh
sw02012-B_048396-048564 yes
sw02012-B_049351-050071 that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private
sw02012-B_050577-050799 [laughter]
sw02012-B_053108-053244 yes
sw02012-B_054086-054204 yes
sw02012-B_054864-056109 that's interesting are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either g- on a growing frequency
sw02012-B_058340-058532 okay
sw02012-B_059398-059776 so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol-
sw02013-A_000087-000276 arch how are you doing tonight
sw02013-A_000276-000651 oh that yeah fine kind of tired
sw02013-A_000651-000866 where am i calling
sw02013-A_000866-001062 where are you
sw02013-A_001062-002212 lewisville okay i'm in garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools
sw02013-A_002212-002649 what do you think about it equalization of funding
sw02013-A_004134-004262 uh-huh
sw02013-A_005308-005502 um-hum [noise]
sw02013-A_006211-006352 [noise]
sw02013-A_006810-007422 but we're not funding them like other states either though you know it we're not funding our schools like other states either
sw02013-A_007422-007964 that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem
sw02013-A_007964-009139 [noise] i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a teacher i feel that yes i f- i definitely feel that way all this money that's being paid for administrators
sw02013-A_009139-009472 hum-um i can
sw02013-A_011542-012114 well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea
sw02013-A_013248-013343 that's true
sw02013-A_013665-014559 but like in garland [noise] you can choose the school that you're going to [noise] can you tell this is past bedtime [laughter] um
sw02013-A_014559-015403 like in garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them if it's out of their district you know out of their area i mean
sw02013-A_015403-015834 so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area
sw02013-A_018024-018428 so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes
sw02013-A_020787-021032 yeah what do you do
sw02013-A_021166-021620 oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field
sw02013-A_021620-021776 well
sw02013-A_021776-022250 [laughter] yeah but that's not a bad one
sw02013-A_024209-024336 yeah
sw02013-A_024967-025197 what do you think about a state income tax
sw02013-A_028456-028862 but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not
sw02013-A_028862-028975 oh
sw02013-A_030629-030870 so what about your income tax
sw02013-A_030870-031088 think they're hitting you too hard
sw02013-A_031262-031458 no
sw02013-A_034293-034397 [noise]
sw02013-A_034397-034540 huh-uh
sw02013-A_036633-037692 which just keeps accumulating [noise] i don't know [noise] what else do you think about them let's see the state
sw02013-A_037978-039027 and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do [laughter] it figures in what is it seven point
sw02013-A_039711-040137 i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store
sw02013-A_040279-040853 because i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out
sw02013-A_040853-041364 so it wouldn't be so bad [noise] all right so you think
sw02013-A_041364-041668 federal tax is okay
sw02013-A_041668-042060 state tax you can see the logic of it but
sw02013-A_042060-042961 you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too
sw02013-A_042961-043196 we don't need anymore
sw02013-A_043571-043999 but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us
sw02013-A_046227-046405 [noise]
sw02013-A_047322-047402 par-
sw02013-A_048143-048443 lots and lots of people before they get it
sw02013-A_048443-048729 but still i work in southeast dallas
sw02013-A_048729-049044 and a lot of my children are from poor
sw02013-A_049044-050366 you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be
sw02013-A_050366-051320 and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars on them and everything and i'm thinking you know this isn't right because my children don't have that
sw02013-A_051964-052756 yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat
sw02013-A_052756-053495 you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right
sw02013-A_053495-054001 [laughter] and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs
sw02013-A_054001-054138 that he
sw02013-A_054138-054743 yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't think i do
sw02013-A_054743-055105 okay well ta- talk to you later then bye
sw02013-A_055105-055266 [noise]
sw02013-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw02013-B_000218-000329 good and yourself
sw02013-B_000619-000806 yeah me too
sw02013-B_000806-000979 pardon me
sw02013-B_000979-001120 i'm in lewisville
sw02013-B_002130-002268 little bit
sw02013-B_002638-003797 that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to have to take away but on the other hand you don't want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to
sw02013-B_003797-004321 uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save
sw02013-B_004321-005407 uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money
sw02013-B_005407-006169 and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that's what we need because we got
sw02013-B_006169-006811 you know texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because we got little kids and we're uh not too pleased about that
sw02013-B_007048-007191 pardon me
sw02013-B_007335-007474 that's true
sw02013-B_007876-008178 yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem
sw02013-B_008365-008528 i think we're gonna s-
sw02013-B_008528-008633 are you
sw02013-B_008633-008781 okay
sw02013-B_008781-009021 i think were gonna see a day come
sw02013-B_009021-009215 yeah
sw02013-B_009215-010309 i think i think we're gonna see a day when s- uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it'll only be to those who are having kids going to school that's probably the most fair way but
sw02013-B_010309-010854 you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to the schools because they don't have little kids going to schools
sw02013-B_010854-011666 but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we'll see what happens
sw02013-B_011947-012078 yeah
sw02013-B_012078-012209 yes
sw02013-B_012209-012361 um
sw02013-B_012361-012633 i don't know that i think has
sw02013-B_012633-012969 pluses and minuses because uh those that
sw02013-B_012969-013765 are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so where's the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that's
sw02013-B_015319-015494 yes
sw02013-B_015494-015639 yes
sw02013-B_015772-016944 i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it's in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh
sw02013-B_016944-017960 that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem
sw02013-B_018228-018355 yeah
sw02013-B_018355-019530 and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise [laughter] tha- [vocalized-noise] that's the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay enough
sw02013-B_019530-020947 i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn't go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for me to do so
sw02013-B_020947-021154 i'm a mathematician
sw02013-B_021334-021487 pardon me
sw02013-B_021487-021826 oh i don't know there are better fields to pick
sw02013-B_022031-022186 i mean
sw02013-B_022186-022794 yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn't using it hardly at all
sw02013-B_022794-023765 so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn't mind getting back into it someday but who knows what'll happen in the future
sw02013-B_023765-024205 the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of uh what happens next
sw02013-B_024205-025002 but uh ba- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something
sw02013-B_025198-026155 i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax
sw02013-B_026155-026305 and
sw02013-B_026305-026732 most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but
sw02013-B_026732-027750 way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem
sw02013-B_027750-027885 um
sw02013-B_027885-028595 which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a s- state lottery because when you bring
sw02013-B_028771-028914 no it didn't
sw02013-B_028914-029477 which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend annie my favorite
sw02013-B_029477-030453 uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state income tax and now she's gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we'll see what happens i don't know
sw02013-B_030453-030675 at any rate uh
sw02013-B_030675-031144 that [vocalized-noise]
sw02013-B_031144-031407 actually no um
sw02013-B_031407-032398 i'm surprised that m- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh we just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out
sw02013-B_032398-032623 uh which is a matter of uh
sw02013-B_032623-032910 um i'm surprised it's
sw02013-B_032910-033441 well considering the national budget i think george bush wanted one point four trillion dollars
sw02013-B_033441-034443 for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it's our share to pay in but i'm not paying that much income tax
sw02013-B_034443-035517 and you're gonna think well wait now [noise] where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in wh- how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but
sw02013-B_035517-035927 it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in debt so deeply
sw02013-B_035927-036575 they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt
sw02013-B_037759-037944 that's about it i guess
sw02013-B_038552-038672 yeah
sw02013-B_038672-038827 yeah
sw02013-B_038988-039756 seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in lewisville it's a lot closer to seven
sw02013-B_039900-039981 hum-um
sw02013-B_040165-040292 how's that
sw02013-B_040771-040918 oh yes
sw02013-B_040918-041082 that's the way to do it
sw02013-B_042416-042552 no
sw02013-B_042841-042984 yeah
sw02013-B_042984-043501 and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax
sw02013-B_043501-043644 uh
sw02013-B_043914-044574 yeah i think what we n- what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending
sw02013-B_044574-045529 because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh
sw02013-B_045529-045954 uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh
sw02013-B_045954-046982 uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year
sw02013-B_046982-048199 and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers
sw02013-B_048199-048525 lots of people yeah yeah
sw02013-B_050308-050413 yeah
sw02013-B_051320-052048 yeah well i don't have that [laughter] a lot of times if i've got a dollar in my wallet it's like boy where do i g- where did where'd i find that
sw02013-B_052680-052819 wow
sw02013-B_053400-053576 yeah right
sw02013-B_053946-054209 quite a quite a world we live in
sw02013-B_054209-054386 oh well
sw02013-B_054663-054950 yeah that's all i have to say thank you

sw02014-A_003099-003250 right
sw02014-A_004006-004958 yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores [laughter]
sw02014-A_005176-006555 [vocalized-noise] i'm from california [vocalized-noise] my mo- the last time i was like purchased a gun my [noise] my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one [noise] and

sw02014-A_007112-007637 [laughter] yeah [noise]
sw02014-A_007637-007850 [noise] it's
sw02014-A_008399-008574 [laughter]
sw02014-A_008714-009073 yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make
sw02014-A_010146-010691 like the bumper sticker [laughter] it's true yeah
sw02014-A_010691-010873 right

sw02014-A_018217-019188 some of them are crazy too [laughter] whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting [laughter]
sw02014-A_019188-020168 [laughter] yeah marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came back

sw02014-A_022249-023006 y- yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay okay okay thanks bye-bye [noise]
sw02014-B_000000-000071 [noise]
sw02014-B_000314-000835 uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four
sw02014-B_000835-001257 i'm not totally i'm not
sw02014-B_001257-002719 one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying uzis either [laughter] you know what i mean [noise] yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think
sw02014-B_002719-004013 that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose a- but i think there should be some [vocalized-noise] restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one
sw02014-B_004349-004512 yeah
sw02014-B_004726-005435 no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think that's kind of scary [laughter]
sw02014-B_006318-006475 uh-huh
sw02014-B_006885-007733 yeah they might be or you know how we are here in texas it's like everybody's a hunter so [laughter] i'm not much of a hunter but
sw02014-B_007733-008783 i've never even bought a gun myself my dad's given it to me or someone's given me one so i'm probably real illegal you know carrying guns that aren't even mine [laughter]
sw02014-B_008971-010234 it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway
sw02014-B_010234-011223 yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so
sw02014-B_011223-011789 and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together
sw02014-B_012619-012763 right
sw02014-B_012951-013124 that's true
sw02014-B_013227-013892 i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them
sw02014-B_014072-014986 right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign up here [laughter] something like that
sw02014-B_015199-015798 right exactly [laughter] before graduation
sw02014-B_016000-016141 yep
sw02014-B_016547-017586 oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they don't see any sense in it at all
sw02014-B_017586-018251 they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that
sw02014-B_018251-019572 don't use it for that [laughter] well yeah that's true [laughter] they shoot each other thinking they're a deer [laughter] yeah darn i thought you were a deer bob sorry my mistake [laughter]
sw02014-B_019572-019860 looked like antlers i don't know [noise]
sw02014-B_019860-020285 [laughter]
sw02014-B_020285-020608 yep that happens a lot too
sw02014-B_020800-021131 but i guess that's it
sw02014-B_021131-021730 that's my opinion on it [laughter] so what now
sw02014-B_021730-021947 uh
sw02014-B_021947-023006 uh i think we just hang up yeah okay [laughter] thanks bye [laughter] [noise]
sw02015-A_000000-000060 [noise]
sw02015-A_000215-000913 have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either
sw02015-A_000913-001295 offering a service or
sw02015-A_001295-001777 they're introducing some new product in the area and
sw02015-A_001777-002432 normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
sw02015-A_002878-003329 that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
sw02015-A_003329-003873 and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
sw02015-A_003873-004731 and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
sw02015-A_004731-005513 or you hear somebody already starting r- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
sw02015-A_006394-006684 even had some of them the
sw02015-A_006684-007167 they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
sw02015-A_008337-008695 what i would love to see done to stop all of this
sw02015-A_008850-009293 we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
sw02015-A_009427-010049 i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
sw02015-A_010049-011470 but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
sw02015-A_013611-014090 that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
sw02015-A_014226-014865 i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
sw02015-A_014865-015563 peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their s- salesman to come out
sw02015-A_021206-021566 now i agree with their right to um
sw02015-A_021668-022598 pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
sw02015-A_022598-023162 i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist
sw02015-A_027442-028402 now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
sw02015-A_028402-029445 i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have g- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
sw02015-A_031637-032619 wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
sw02015-A_032619-032963 but i consider invasion of my privacy
sw02015-A_032963-033178 a harassment in itself
sw02015-A_033965-034281 i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
sw02015-A_037119-037326 i'm drawing the blank
sw02015-A_037855-038175 uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
sw02015-A_038283-038573 and take it easy now good night
sw02015-A_038573-038866 [noise]
sw02015-B_000000-000074 [noise]
sw02015-B_002372-002571 yes yes
sw02015-B_002673-002951 that is that one that you were talking about
sw02015-B_003724-003948 uh-huh uh-huh
sw02015-B_004206-004362 [laughter]
sw02015-B_004594-004753 um-hum
sw02015-B_005425-006315 that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too
sw02015-B_007072-008219 uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i- i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
sw02015-B_008612-008751 uh-huh
sw02015-B_009220-009369 um-hum
sw02015-B_011419-012440 um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
sw02015-B_012440-012914 so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy
sw02015-B_012914-013246 i agree with you on that particular subject there
sw02015-B_013351-013516 let me see
sw02015-B_014234-014364 um-hum
sw02015-B_015478-015679 um-hum um-hum
sw02015-B_015679-016740 yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
sw02015-B_016740-018136 uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
sw02015-B_018136-018670 [noise] and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
sw02015-B_018670-020097 [noise] and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh jesus christ of latter day saints
sw02015-B_020097-021054 and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
sw02015-B_022530-022676 um-hum
sw02015-B_022900-023066 right
sw02015-B_023066-024323 yeah yeah no i- i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either
sw02015-B_024323-025705 and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
sw02015-B_025705-026716 and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
sw02015-B_026716-027422 and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
sw02015-B_029256-030657 [laughter] yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something
sw02015-B_030657-031205 but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like th- they see that word and it says uh go
sw02015-B_031205-031425 [laughter] instead of stop
sw02015-B_031425-031654 oh goodness
sw02015-B_032201-032619 [laughter]
sw02015-B_032619-032762 oh gosh
sw02015-B_032885-033113 yeah yeah
sw02015-B_033113-033537 yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true
sw02015-B_033537-033859 hm well what else
sw02015-B_034231-034769 i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think
sw02015-B_034769-035639 you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
sw02015-B_035890-036117 and i can't remember what it was
sw02015-B_036117-036932 and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
sw02015-B_037240-037507 [laughter]

sw02017-A_006603-007548 heard a lot about richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range
sw02017-A_008242-008386 um-hum
sw02017-A_008751-008913 [laughter]
sw02017-A_009084-009218 yes

sw02017-A_013608-013755 um-hum
sw02017-A_013995-014129 hm
sw02017-A_015235-015419 oh that's good
sw02017-A_015840-015936 [laughter]
sw02017-A_015936-016705 well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here
sw02017-A_017744-017886 hm
sw02017-A_018197-018338 uh-huh
sw02017-A_018830-018958 [laughter]

sw02017-A_022664-022798 oh
sw02017-A_022798-024058 oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time homeowners i'm still scared about everything like that [laughter] going wrong and how do you know it's going to happen and all
sw02017-A_024786-024930 um-hum
sw02017-A_025111-025388 we really like our school out here
sw02017-A_025388-025584 but we um
sw02017-A_025584-025904 we were scared to buy a an house
sw02017-A_025904-027140 in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn't know um you know if we were afraid we'd be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something
sw02017-A_027542-027664 um-hum
sw02017-A_028325-028465 hm
sw02017-A_029820-029965 um-hum
sw02017-A_030918-031560 well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three
sw02017-A_031560-032483 house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years
sw02017-A_032629-032804 it's slab
sw02017-A_033318-033439 um-hum
sw02017-A_033718-033869 um-hum
sw02017-A_034499-034686 well that's good
sw02017-A_035191-036248 yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so
sw02017-A_036248-036989 well i uh appreciate that information about richardson i know it was um it's got a really good reputation and
sw02017-A_037558-037654 [laughter]
sw02017-A_037654-038481 fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you g- good luck with this program then bye-bye
sw02017-A_038481-038782 [noise]
sw02017-B_000073-000221 okay
sw02017-B_000350-000490 oh
sw02017-B_000929-001863 okay um well i've lived in the in the dallas and richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years
sw02017-B_001863-002855 and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in richardson
sw02017-B_002855-002975 [noise]
sw02017-B_002975-003517 we've lived in the richardson area for that you know for the full time uh
sw02017-B_003943-004001 [noise]
sw02017-B_004001-005230 well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in plano so uh the uh the plano area and the richardson area probably are are about the same pricewise i would think
sw02017-B_005230-005392 yeah so
sw02017-B_006881-007002 yeah
sw02017-B_007408-007688 yeah well um
sw02017-B_007688-008863 [noise] i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i've it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a house so
sw02017-B_008863-010022 [laughter] so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our pri- that the the value of our house went up you know considerably o- over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period
sw02017-B_010022-010803 but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so
sw02017-B_010803-011769 but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so
sw02017-B_011769-013000 uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a c._p._a. and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days
sw02017-B_013000-014036 and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it's uh in dallas but it's in the richardson school district
sw02017-B_014036-015297 and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she w- you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so
sw02017-B_015297-015969 so i i suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now
sw02017-B_016600-017789 well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice
sw02017-B_017789-018254 because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that
sw02017-B_018254-019448 but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a u. shape
sw02017-B_019448-019998 and in inside that u. but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is
sw02017-B_019998-021114 and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house
sw02017-B_021114-021948 and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so
sw02017-B_022140-023140 no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the sheetrock or in things right
sw02017-B_023524-023853 yeah uh but uh
sw02017-B_023853-025135 yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location richardson plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise
sw02017-B_025251-025403 yeah so
sw02017-B_026263-026411 um-hum
sw02017-B_026873-026994 [laughter]
sw02017-B_026994-028382 yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the b- you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation
sw02017-B_028382-029327 and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete
sw02017-B_029327-029890 and makes it more uh s- more stable and and puts more strength into it
sw02017-B_029890-030133 so uh you know it it
sw02017-B_030133-030213 [noise]
sw02017-B_030213-030997 uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so
sw02017-B_030997-031146 yeah so
sw02017-B_031146-031352 [noise]
sw02017-B_031670-031822 um-hum
sw02017-B_032018-032158 yeah
sw02017-B_032158-032677 right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam
sw02017-B_032677-032753 [noise]
sw02017-B_032753-033796 yeah so that's and that's what ours is our h- the house we had before was over we live on the east side of richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house
sw02017-B_033796-034564 and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so
sw02017-B_034564-035195 yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder
sw02017-B_035195-035390 [noise]
sw02017-B_036052-036178 yeah
sw02017-B_036487-036628 okay
sw02017-B_036744-036924 [laughter]
sw02017-B_036924-037691 yeah so well it uh you know i think it's a a good place to live uh or course if i didn't think that well we wouldn't still be living here so
sw02017-B_037691-037880 right yeah that would
sw02017-B_037880-038106 okay thank you uh
sw02017-B_038283-038443 okay thank you you too
sw02017-B_038443-038782 [noise]
sw02018-A_000000-000376 hello this is lois
sw02018-A_000512-001158 and um i called you know from that the the t._i. database calling instructions
sw02018-A_001394-001810 yeah this is about changes in women in the
sw02018-A_001810-002363 uh there's really a lot isn't there i mean there really is
sw02018-A_002467-003200 oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh
sw02018-A_003421-003548 okay
sw02018-A_003548-003695 [noise]
sw02018-A_003695-004723 all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations
sw02018-A_005958-007301 um no i think n- now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
sw02018-A_007423-007959 oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is
sw02018-A_008408-008702 oh i can't either not a one
sw02018-A_009515-009598 um-hum
sw02018-A_009898-010516 yeah even in washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved
sw02018-A_010942-011196 yes yes
sw02018-A_011196-011658 oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it
sw02018-A_011658-012028 yes yeah yes

sw02018-A_032103-032255 um-hum
sw02018-A_032255-033164 yeah but i can remem- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
sw02018-A_033164-033450 oh yes
sw02018-A_033450-033577 um-hum
sw02018-A_033790-034185 where oh yeah yes
sw02018-A_034601-034794 oh i do too
sw02018-A_034994-035260 yes yes yes
sw02018-A_035702-036035 um-hum they really are
sw02018-A_036609-037185 [laughter] i- know i know the feeling well it wa- okay and i sure will and bye-bye
sw02018-A_037185-037286 [noise]
sw02018-B_000000-000139 hello
sw02018-B_000139-000314 hi
sw02018-B_000314-000535 hi this is lisa
sw02018-B_000881-001084 um-hum
sw02018-B_001084-001478 yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though
sw02018-B_001687-001908 um-hum
sw02018-B_001908-002209 yeah [laughter]
sw02018-B_002209-002517 -t's kind of an easy thing to talk about
sw02018-B_002905-003070 yeah
sw02018-B_003070-003550 um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it
sw02018-B_003736-004045 okay yes
sw02018-B_004445-004661 yes i know because
sw02018-B_004661-005898 i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all
sw02018-B_006403-006585 uh-huh
sw02018-B_007112-007524 yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better
sw02018-B_007704-007887 um-hum
sw02018-B_007887-008425 because women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in
sw02018-B_008616-009984 i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
sw02018-B_010088-010260 yeah
sw02018-B_010441-011399 hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal
sw02018-B_011500-012508 uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh
sw02018-B_012508-012721 [laughter]
sw02018-B_013037-013191 yeah
sw02018-B_013594-014312 exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it
sw02018-B_014632-014831 um-hum
sw02018-B_014831-015002 and then
sw02018-B_015138-015276 um-hum
sw02018-B_015276-016453 also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
sw02018-B_016453-016650 is it
sw02018-B_016650-016887 that would be great
sw02018-B_016887-017836 or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on l._o._a. to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house
sw02018-B_017836-019067 and sh- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too
sw02018-B_019067-020122 i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office
sw02018-B_020122-020621 so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing
sw02018-B_020621-020802 do you
sw02018-B_020802-021193 do you work like half days or half weeks or
sw02018-B_021346-021487 hm
sw02018-B_021707-021971 oh is oh that's great
sw02018-B_021971-022300 uh-huh do you get the full benefits
sw02018-B_022400-022628 oh that's wonderful
sw02018-B_022817-023415 yeah especially with children and so many things going on that would be great
sw02018-B_023742-024503 either way yeah [noise] you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially if you have young children
sw02018-B_024665-024823 um-hum
sw02018-B_024941-026065 oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
sw02018-B_026065-026248 yeah
sw02018-B_026390-027480 [noise] i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful
sw02018-B_027480-028578 plus i bet it cuts [vocalized-noise] cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
sw02018-B_028895-030209 um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening
sw02018-B_030209-031440 so that's real helpful so you don't [vocalized-noise] you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand
sw02018-B_031440-031617 so
sw02018-B_031617-032345 uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just it's always been that way but i know
sw02018-B_033050-033977 oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
sw02018-B_033977-035237 i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor- women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but
sw02018-B_035237-035861 mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward
sw02018-B_035861-036276 yeah i think it's getting better not worse
sw02018-B_036276-036807 well i should probably get back to my job [laughter]
sw02018-B_036807-037022 [noise] call again
sw02018-B_037022-037215 okay bye-bye

sw02019-B_002956-003839 it uh definitely responds to uh to authority and i've had dogs in the past and uh
sw02019-B_003839-004858 it seems it seems to uh respond real well i- it she- she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i'd like to say [laughter]
sw02019-B_005151-005449 well about a year i guess
sw02019-B_005750-006109 it just turned two i believe

sw02019-B_016764-016965 yeah definitely
sw02019-B_017164-018267 yeah i can honestly say we do um we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order to uh
sw02019-B_018267-019466 to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but
sw02019-B_019466-020331 we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and r- run around
sw02019-B_020707-020847 really
sw02019-B_021244-021436 oh wow
sw02019-B_021580-021724 yeah

sw02019-B_023432-023585 okay
sw02019-B_023685-023857 most definitely
sw02019-B_024252-024974 yeah yeah the yeah that's a that's a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
sw02019-B_025908-026054 um-hum
sw02019-B_026671-026876 wow that's uh
sw02019-B_027174-027408 yeah that's interesting
sw02019-B_027674-028439 yeah i kn- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh
sw02019-B_028439-029751 if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine i- if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared
sw02019-B_029751-030628 uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion w- with uh with younger kids
sw02019-B_030628-031536 but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in south dakota
sw02019-B_031536-032051 and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about
sw02019-B_032051-033489 three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog kind kind of felt out of place then because she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so
sw02019-B_033601-035073 she really did she just uh she she was alm- she was just inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh
sw02019-B_035073-035784 it was it was just su- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh
sw02019-B_035896-036083 uh pardon
sw02019-B_036083-036319 oh it's uh mitzi
sw02019-B_036319-036476 yeah

sw02020-A_001396-002582 listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and
sw02020-A_002582-003769 uh quite honestly i i have some little children and i've unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice how about you
sw02020-A_004020-004225 [laughter]
sw02020-A_004225-004330 [laughter]

sw02020-A_008849-009399 how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days
sw02020-A_009629-009761 um-hum
sw02020-A_010251-010399 um-hum
sw02020-A_010552-010697 right

sw02020-A_012614-012950 uh-huh uh-huh
sw02020-A_013760-013919 right
sw02020-A_014899-016119 yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm
sw02020-A_016119-016988 and uh sounds th- sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and
sw02020-A_016988-018096 uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
sw02020-A_018598-018776 that's right
sw02020-A_019720-019904 no
sw02020-A_019904-021027 yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the m._c. hammer who's really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um
sw02020-A_021027-021711 wild thing do you remember that that song he used i can't remember who the artist was on that
sw02020-A_021711-021873 who
sw02020-A_021873-022126 was it well
sw02020-A_022126-022830 may- maybe it wasn't that one then because it's a living it was a living person that i'm that i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey
sw02020-A_022830-023995 that's those are my words [laughter] and uh i guess that they're they because he hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and
sw02020-A_023995-024398 paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but [laughter]
sw02020-A_025519-025749 maybe so i
sw02020-A_025749-025974 i can't think
sw02020-A_027031-027198 yeah

sw02020-B_000000-000178 [noise]
sw02020-B_000178-000474 hi um
sw02020-B_000474-001049 okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like
sw02020-B_002153-002298 yeah
sw02020-B_003300-003475 [laughter]
sw02020-B_003475-003648 oh really
sw02020-B_003648-003850 well um
sw02020-B_003850-005249 [laughter] i don't have that i don't have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the st- stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car um
sw02020-B_005249-006246 uh however i d- i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i- i think i like uh
sw02020-B_006246-006424 i
sw02020-B_006424-007349 i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh th- there's such a wide selection i think i like a lot
sw02020-B_007349-007784 or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i i-
sw02020-B_007784-009071 i i like music that is that that i feel if it's performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if it's not then i won't [laughter] i i really don't
sw02020-B_009071-009277 rap
sw02020-B_009277-010114 yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i d- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is i-
sw02020-B_010114-011058 when it becomes militant or if it's uh violence oriented i i'm i- i r- i have i have strong objections to that um
sw02020-B_011058-011730 actually i listened to one time i -member it's this is back when r- even
sw02020-B_011730-012161 uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
sw02020-B_012161-012450 yeah right when it was just starting i heard
sw02020-B_012450-013856 what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of mus- the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap
sw02020-B_013856-015129 and um you you listen a lot if you l- if you l- hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it y-
sw02020-B_015775-015924 yeah
sw02020-B_016123-016265 yeah
sw02020-B_017625-017800 yeah
sw02020-B_017800-018025 yeah
sw02020-B_018025-019363 they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really
sw02020-B_019363-020054 give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that's really due to them
sw02020-B_020549-020720 yeah
sw02020-B_021150-021407 yeah um-hum
sw02020-B_021510-022052 yeah it jimi hendrix was the original jimi hendrix was the original he wrote
sw02020-B_022479-022719 okay
sw02020-B_023331-023475 um-hum
sw02020-B_023924-024374 [laughter]
sw02020-B_024374-025335 yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i th- i think that even jimi hendrix did a i think that was a cov- i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of
sw02020-B_025335-025782 like a john lee hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old
sw02020-B_025782-026622 i mean i i it it a l- there're a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that
sw02020-B_026622-027675 that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and i'm like you know i i don't wanna listen to this [laughter] because you know you think of the original it's like you know oh that was really great that was a you know
sw02020-B_027675-029000 really good piece of work and then y- when you hear the cover it's like you know god you know what what are they doing to this [laughter] oh i th- i think a good one was um there was a peter frampton song
sw02020-B_029000-029727 y- and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolu- it was pitiful [laughter]
sw02020-B_029926-031400 yeah there's [laughter] yeah but you know whatever became of peter frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything
sw02020-B_031400-032317 yeah yeah i i think i think that prob- yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
sw02020-B_032317-032537 yeah
sw02020-B_032748-033170 [laughter] oh man
sw02020-B_033170-034120 [laughter] yeah i've i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was
sw02020-B_034120-035403 i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the a._o._r. type music um the the album oriented like the uh james taylor and
sw02020-B_035403-036416 the uh the beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they're better than the beatles and i'm like you know you you don't know what you're talking about
sw02020-B_036416-037252 [laughter] oh i mean you know c- the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles i mean it was just
sw02020-B_037252-038147 [laughter] yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you [laughter] know at this point but
sw02020-B_038258-039505 yeah but we- well you know i mean i i've i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the
sw02020-B_039505-039780 in the mid and early eighties and then
sw02020-B_039780-040805 um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music
sw02020-B_040805-042252 which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah paul simon well you know really that's not world music but w- what paul simon's doing i think is is is is great because he's
sw02020-B_042252-043492 uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know u- drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um
sw02020-B_043492-044120 well world music is um a lot of the a lot of
sw02020-B_044120-045484 where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let's say you're taking like an original brazilian form of music
sw02020-B_045484-046139 a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for
sw02020-B_046139-047565 let's say another audience let's say a north american and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music
sw02020-B_047565-048916 because i mean there are some i mean i l- there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know i- and it's the same way with w- you know world music takes
sw02020-B_048916-049623 the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know
sw02020-B_049623-051000 the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking
sw02020-B_051111-051730 yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um
sw02020-B_051730-052459 uh i think that they don't use elec- el- some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
sw02020-B_052459-053000 so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now
sw02020-B_053000-053938 and from west africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
sw02020-B_053938-054767 but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good ex- another good example was i heard miles davis
sw02020-B_054767-055780 and miles davis worked with ravi shankar if you can believe it [laughter] i mean you know he's this jazz performer and then he's playing with ravi shankar who's a very good
sw02020-B_055780-056264 he's a very good arranger uh [vocalized-noise] arrangement to [vocalized-noise]
sw02020-B_056264-057596 but uh were going to get off [vocalized-noise] [laughter] i don't know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it's just incredible
sw02020-B_057596-058555 yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never th- would think that they that they can actually play together but
sw02022-A_000000-000082 [noise]
sw02022-A_000082-000777 okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a
sw02022-A_000777-001904 computer here at the house and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
sw02022-A_001904-002622 and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on
sw02022-A_002622-003488 whatever we've got coming in check coming in and how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also sp-
sw02022-A_003488-004629 and because our house payment is once a month that's our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it's really still there
sw02022-A_004629-005367 so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do y'all do
sw02022-A_008543-009091 um-hum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well
sw02022-A_009479-010055 um-hum and and you're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good
sw02022-A_010215-010463 yeah i foun-
sw02022-A_010739-010873 um-hum
sw02022-A_011135-011267 yeah
sw02022-A_011732-012101 you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that
sw02022-A_012273-012398 yeah
sw02022-A_012502-013023 that's a good choice we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year we've budgeted
sw02022-A_013023-014261 the money that we used to spend we were spending on a coda account with t._i. and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh
sw02022-A_014261-015284 we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear
sw02022-A_015837-015977 yeah
sw02022-A_015977-016434 that's good to be in that kind of shape what are y'all trying to do long term
sw02022-A_017484-017574 uh-huh
sw02022-A_017574-018101 [noise]
sw02022-A_018101-018996 yeah mostly what we're doing we've worked [noise] we've done the uh coda account with t._i. where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they [noise] match it
sw02022-A_018996-020311 [noise] and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for t._i. and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an i._r._a. and we had an out
sw02022-A_020311-020963 we had an existing i._r._a. so we have both of us have some money in an i._r._a. that we're also trying to figure to
sw02022-A_020963-021772 put it we're putting it in c._d.s right now and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a [noise] mutual fund
sw02022-A_021772-022140 [noise] um-hum
sw02022-A_022324-023097 yeah [noise] the other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um
sw02022-A_023097-024195 [noise] han- oh [noise] john hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary [noise] and uh what we were pla- what
sw02022-A_024195-025014 what what our uh goals were on a long [noise] term budget in terms of retirement kid's college paying off the house buying a different house
sw02022-A_025014-025884 um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at
sw02022-A_025884-027202 and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time
sw02022-A_027773-027894 um-hum
sw02022-A_028452-028611 um-hum
sw02022-A_028611-028834 yeah that
sw02022-A_028834-030027 that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me

sw02023-A_047299-047477 it [vocalized-noise]
sw02023-A_047998-048873 i know i couldn't uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh
sw02023-A_048873-049521 cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out
sw02023-A_049521-049652 and uh
sw02023-A_049652-050393 that's got us in a little bit of trouble now that's why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there
sw02023-A_051347-051749 uh uh my hubby does not have uh
sw02023-A_051749-052450 too much control when it comes to using that card uh [laughter] i know uh
sw02023-A_052450-052866 uh for quite a while we was using them to uh
sw02023-A_052866-053227 uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent
sw02023-A_053227-053448 you know it uh
sw02023-A_053448-054468 when we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day
sw02023-A_054468-055623 and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was [noise] paying
sw02023-A_055623-056176 the rent plu- try- plus trying to get the money for an- ca- another car and
sw02023-A_056176-056479 it got it got real rough
sw02023-A_056479-056849 he just popped out that uh master card and
sw02023-A_056977-057601 yeah we got a big cash advance and really that's what's uh holding us back now that's
sw02023-A_058575-058921 yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk
sw02023-A_059080-060018 that's what i'm looking for now that's why i was just trying talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing
sw02023-B_000105-000206 okay
sw02023-B_000449-001101 oh yes [laughter] and i believe we all do and and it's just too easy to use
sw02023-B_001299-002147 [laughter] oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much
sw02023-B_002597-002767 [laughter]
sw02023-B_002767-003800 um it uh [vocalized-noise] you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i'd rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash
sw02023-B_004350-004534 uh yes
sw02023-B_004675-005073 yes that's uh real easy to do i have to watch it
sw02023-B_005073-005494 in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament
sw02023-B_005599-005749 um
sw02023-B_005898-006733 they they've um you know they've they've made them too easy to and too accessible at everything to to buy
sw02023-B_006850-007123 oh yes
sw02023-B_007250-007621 and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down
sw02023-B_008299-008448 oh uh-huh
sw02023-B_008700-008898 oh that's good
sw02023-B_009349-009599 [laughter]
sw02023-B_009849-010500 oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle
sw02023-B_010650-011200 as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan
sw02023-B_011400-011550 oh no
sw02023-B_011550-012426 um yeah the a._t._m.'s they're but they're nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed
sw02023-B_013021-013672 oh that's the best way it's used [laughter] that's the best way yes now i think that sort of
sw02023-B_013672-014349 evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something
sw02023-B_014349-014474 [laughter]
sw02023-B_015021-015149 [laughter]
sw02023-B_015350-015900 and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it
sw02023-B_016227-016572 [laughter]
sw02023-B_016572-017497 oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah
sw02023-B_017900-018064 oh
sw02023-B_018064-018270 those are fun
sw02023-B_018270-018550 you get started on them and can't quit
sw02023-B_018550-018872 [laughter] just exactly
sw02023-B_018872-019049 [laughter]
sw02023-B_019198-020127 oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping s- frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything
sw02023-B_020946-021478 yeah i- there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if
sw02023-B_022098-022224 [laughter]
sw02023-B_022474-022629 yeah they
sw02023-B_023101-023298 oh yeah that's it
sw02023-B_023550-023918 oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just
sw02023-B_023918-024549 you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you don't care how much it costs or what it takes
sw02023-B_025571-025718 uh-huh
sw02023-B_025831-026544 yeah that's uh i always end up going into wal-mart and [vocalized-noise] coming out with everything that uh i didn't have on the list
sw02023-B_026544-026931 we're just getting more than what we went in for [laughter]
sw02023-B_027249-027399 uh-huh
sw02023-B_027672-027824 [laughter]
sw02023-B_028019-028147 [laughter]
sw02023-B_029599-029851 oh yeah it's dangerous
sw02023-B_030671-031449 um-hum oh yeah it's just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we're we're infamous about that
sw02023-B_031449-031575 and so
sw02023-B_031699-031849 [laughter]
sw02023-B_031849-032450 oh well yeah i well i'm i'm glad we have credit cards that's uh
sw02023-B_032450-032946 because in sometimes when there's an emergency it it comes in handy
sw02023-B_032946-033129 it's nice to have
sw02023-B_033522-033650 yeah
sw02023-B_033753-033971 we've yeah we've had uh

sw02023-B_035323-035896 huh-uh no no i think it's become too much of an everyday life here they're part of it
sw02023-B_036263-036498 [laughter]
sw02023-B_037134-037321 [laughter]

sw02024-A_022580-022895 well i don't know um
sw02024-A_022895-024207 i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would
sw02024-A_024207-025160 be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know g- getting your yourself in gear to
sw02024-A_025160-026086 uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do [vocalized-noise] convincing you that you need to get on with it

sw02024-A_033315-033438 yeah
sw02024-A_033928-035164 well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work
sw02024-A_035861-036803 oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but
sw02024-A_037007-037225 yeah yeah
sw02024-A_037896-038025 yeah
sw02024-A_038253-038609 okay well any other comments

sw02024-A_040198-040417 [noise]
sw02024-B_000100-000322 wonderful touch tone telephone there
sw02024-B_000670-001572 uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um
sw02024-B_001572-002908 [noise] i get a charge out of uh texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh
sw02024-B_002908-003387 about the different areas of of the k- of the state by reading it
sw02024-B_004412-005339 oh yeah it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things it's pretty pretty neat
sw02024-B_005339-006184 um oh i like photography um [noise] magazines i don't take a subscription or anything like that um
sw02024-B_006184-006485 things oh
sw02024-B_006590-007776 being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and
sw02024-B_007776-009088 and uh kind of strange because i'll [vocalized-noise] it's not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh [noise] how about yourself
sw02024-B_009424-009562 um-hum
sw02024-B_010269-010430 [noise] oh that's great
sw02024-B_012228-012361 um-hum
sw02024-B_012550-012871 i bet that would be rather interesting uh
sw02024-B_013004-013947 that's uh self-improvement that's that's alw- well that's that's kind of a hobby but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um
sw02024-B_014439-014610 [noise] um [noise]
sw02024-B_014610-014859 well i hate to yes i do
sw02024-B_014859-014892 [laughter]
sw02024-B_014892-015929 we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was
sw02024-B_015929-017305 [noise] at america's service by carl albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the t._i. culture here at texas instruments
sw02024-B_017305-017974 um one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
sw02024-B_017974-019155 [noise] uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um
sw02024-B_019155-020132 every now and then i'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh
sw02024-B_020132-020993 better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of pat haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type
sw02024-B_020993-021256 actually which all you know betters yourself
sw02024-B_021965-022099 um-hum
sw02024-B_022344-022616 [laughter] like what for example
sw02024-B_024751-024877 um-hum
sw02024-B_025710-025854 sure
sw02024-B_026020-026881 sure how about items like um the one minute manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um
sw02024-B_026881-027537 our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know
sw02024-B_027537-028503 by a main man named uh doctor bittel b. i. t. t. e. l. and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people
sw02024-B_028503-029165 and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers [laughter]
sw02024-B_029165-030173 so it's it's ver- it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it's really uh excellent fast reading and uh
sw02024-B_030173-031188 but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say -kay read these ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them
sw02024-B_031188-032047 he casually just walked into it and uh put down a stephen king book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting [laughter]
sw02024-B_032612-033397 yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and course they're always a little spookier than the movies but uh
sw02024-B_033397-033921 it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books
sw02024-B_035080-035225 um-hum
sw02024-B_035225-035997 in quality -pecially nowadays uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of th-
sw02024-B_036298-036544 exactly exactly right
sw02024-B_036755-038031 [noise] yeah w- we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what wh- what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh
sw02024-B_038031-038214 that's kind of part of it
sw02024-B_038591-039435 uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two [laughter]
sw02024-B_039435-039736 ah this is true i've enjoyed it
sw02024-B_039736-039854 ha-
sw02024-B_039995-040223 have a good day bye-bye
sw02024-B_040223-040417 [noise]
sw02025-A_000000-000233 all right amy how are you doing today
sw02025-A_000233-000841 oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that
sw02025-A_000841-002006 um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back
sw02025-A_002006-002036 [noise]
sw02025-A_002036-002288 hangings on weekends
sw02025-A_002402-002772 in public places there is one state that does that by the way
sw02025-A_002772-003118 i want to say oklahoma i saw re- something the other night about it
sw02025-A_003118-003470 they don't do them real often [vocalized-noise] which is obviously the death penalty
sw02025-A_003470-004030 um but i think if we quit uh building these taj mahals with the color t._v.s
sw02025-A_004030-005148 and sixty doll- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just quit screwing up the system uh
sw02025-A_005926-006094 that's pathetic
sw02025-A_006284-006480 that's pathetic i-
sw02025-A_008255-008840 this is true a- a- a- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to
sw02025-A_008840-009864 life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit bsing with the system
sw02025-A_010954-011100 exactly
sw02025-A_011448-011628 a life for a life
sw02025-A_012671-012987 the old charles manson case i mean the guy is really
sw02025-A_012987-013033 [vocalized-noise]
sw02025-A_013213-014045 just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge [noise]
sw02025-A_014045-014661 [noise] the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene
sw02025-A_014661-015660 uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in fort worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off
sw02025-A_015660-016109 uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
sw02025-A_016109-017351 um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
sw02025-A_017351-017941 there's a per- certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
sw02025-A_017941-018144 the guy's guilty
sw02025-A_019051-019199 exactly
sw02025-A_019777-020506 exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial whi- is x. number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
sw02025-A_020506-021141 i think that that if it's an if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
sw02025-A_021141-022248 uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
sw02025-A_028265-028381 hm
sw02025-A_028752-029811 yeah ye- i get back to price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
sw02025-A_029811-029954 exactly
sw02025-A_029954-031202 yeah yeah i mean you're you're in dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense
sw02025-A_031202-031710 you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer
sw02025-A_031978-032477 this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation
sw02025-A_032931-033194 oh so you're at the house you're not at the plant
sw02025-A_033378-033525 oh hold it
sw02025-A_033525-033989 oh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure
sw02025-A_034193-034697 oh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye
sw02025-B_000147-000353 fine fine
sw02025-B_000472-000609 yeah
sw02025-B_000712-000890 okay you go ahead
sw02025-B_001636-001759 um-hum
sw02025-B_002250-002440 in public places
sw02025-B_002440-002593 yeah
sw02025-B_002694-002874 really what is that
sw02025-B_003065-003231 hm
sw02025-B_003231-003397 yeah
sw02025-B_003397-003563 yeah
sw02025-B_004948-006352 yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
sw02025-B_006352-006878 because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or [noise]
sw02025-B_006878-008308 you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
sw02025-B_008308-008552 you know it's crazy
sw02025-B_009486-009629 yeah
sw02025-B_009783-011051 well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for s- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
sw02025-B_011051-011701 so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
sw02025-B_011701-012805 i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like you know one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
sw02025-B_012805-013342 yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um
sw02025-B_013527-013673 yeah
sw02025-B_013908-014055 um-hum
sw02025-B_015906-016228 right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
sw02025-B_017847-019136 right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a f- you know a fortune to keep doing that
sw02025-B_019136-019842 and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
sw02025-B_020204-020349 right
sw02025-B_020349-020587 yeah yeah
sw02025-B_021045-021255 yeah yeah
sw02025-B_021938-022188 yeah yeah
sw02025-B_022188-023430 well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
sw02025-B_023430-024219 you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
sw02025-B_024219-025390 and have some judge that was paid off or you know had goo- a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
sw02025-B_025390-026503 you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but [noise] seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
sw02025-B_026503-027480 but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
sw02025-B_027480-028289 and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
sw02025-B_028289-028837 it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it
sw02025-B_028837-028952 you know
sw02025-B_029397-029688 [laughter]
sw02025-B_029688-030225 he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah
sw02025-B_031141-031278 yeah
sw02025-B_031379-031517 yeah
sw02025-B_031628-032081 oh they'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically
sw02025-B_032081-032266 yeah yeah
sw02025-B_032386-033607 well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with two little ki- preschoolers [noise] my husband works for t._i.

sw02025-B_033807-034653 oh yeah i've got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room [laughter] okay thanks a lot bye-bye
sw02025-B_034882-035067 [noise]
sw02027-A_001098-001647 [laughter] w-
sw02027-A_003326-004398 well i'm kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
sw02027-A_004398-005397 and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i'm doing that and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry
sw02027-A_005397-006656 you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting
sw02027-A_006656-007605 where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff
sw02027-A_008500-008668 um-hum
sw02027-A_009873-010023 um-hum
sw02027-A_010349-010618 that's right that's right
sw02027-A_010618-011561 a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at t._i. the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through
sw02027-A_011561-012409 two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned
sw02027-A_012409-013032 and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty
sw02027-A_013032-014459 um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought t._i. dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no
sw02027-A_014459-015860 and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he sh- he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there
sw02027-A_015860-017073 and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts
sw02027-A_017073-018068 he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it [laughter]
sw02027-A_018068-018448 [laughter] yeah
sw02027-A_018782-018930 uh-huh

sw02027-A_035700-035904 [laughter]
sw02027-A_036956-037473 well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because
sw02027-A_037473-038809 we had uh another person coming from washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
sw02027-A_038809-039240 and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
sw02027-A_039240-039848 and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse
sw02027-A_039848-040859 you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're gonna have to un- unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid
sw02027-A_040859-041177 and she
sw02027-A_041177-042375 and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her
sw02027-A_042375-042821 [laughter]
sw02027-A_044626-044821 um-hum
sw02027-A_046347-047739 some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
sw02027-A_047739-048735 and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more yuppyish and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
sw02027-A_048735-049817 and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just you
sw02027-A_049817-050348 [laughter] you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we
sw02027-A_050348-051569 we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with tiers
sw02027-A_051569-052398 like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual
sw02027-A_052623-052765 yeah
sw02027-A_053685-055174 [laughter] it's it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here [laughter]
sw02027-A_055174-056548 yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i've done i've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different
sw02027-A_056548-057072 yeah okay bye [noise]
sw02027-B_000000-001250 okay um i don't know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next [laughter]
sw02027-B_001250-002183 it's pretty bad but it's true [laughter] you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know
sw02027-B_002183-003576 we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next [laughter]
sw02027-B_004300-004458 yeah
sw02027-B_007198-008577 y- yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and
sw02027-B_008577-009361 and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know y- you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not
sw02027-B_009361-010825 you know i i've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it's just so it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so
sw02027-B_011854-012099 uh
sw02027-B_013899-014099 uh-huh

sw02027-B_017864-018957 oh how awful sounds like mister power hungry [laughter] but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
sw02027-B_018957-019505 and i don't care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want
sw02027-B_019505-020678 but these were shorts is all they were i mean i- i don't care what else you call them you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these weren't even really
sw02027-B_020678-021599 full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because these weren't even those these were like
sw02027-B_021599-022514 pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice
sw02027-B_022514-023948 but you don't wear shorts to work you know i mean [laughter] as far as i'm concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them it's always been a big problem in lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an
sw02027-B_023948-024822 cut off you know that yeah no this is where we're going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know
sw02027-B_024822-025624 so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well god we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but
sw02027-B_026154-026344 yeah
sw02027-B_026344-027193 uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know
sw02027-B_027193-028598 i mean i've never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts i don't care what you say they're shorts you know well i think t._i.'s dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i

sw02027-B_033099-033778 t._i. says no shorts and no halters you know that's it [laughter]
sw02027-B_033778-033999 wow
sw02027-B_034598-035017 i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i
sw02027-B_035017-035764 i see i- i am more i don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts but i am more productive when i'm in pants
sw02027-B_035764-037150 i- i am i work faster i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels you know i it and it's weird but i it's i do i i can i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable you know

sw02027-B_042650-042954 well i don't know i just figure
sw02027-B_042954-043198 you know yeah sometimes i worry about
sw02027-B_043198-044500 you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but i'll go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not
sw02027-B_044500-045550 cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if
sw02027-B_045550-046495 you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know i don't know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know

sw02027-B_052296-053498 that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit
sw02027-B_053498-054150 it's gonna make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know [laughter] or it would me you know

sw02028-B_012848-013404 buy a new spark plug or something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh
sw02028-B_013404-013596 do not have to
sw02028-B_013596-014306 go out and buy the spark plug no but we've had an unusually uh uh warm
sw02028-B_014411-014824 spring and well i guess we're still in winter and uh
sw02028-B_014824-015046 we have had no snow
sw02028-B_015046-015308 to speak of to speak of
sw02028-B_015308-015830 we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and
sw02028-B_015830-016550 this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
sw02028-B_016550-017219 so it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year

sw02028-B_052101-052264 beforehand
sw02028-B_052264-052458 so i
sw02028-B_052458-052988 but th- that's interesting i have a um uh a friend who
sw02028-B_052988-053198 is a planner

sw02028-B_054850-054990 to
sw02028-B_055425-055552 um-hum
sw02028-B_056068-056225 oh i see
sw02028-B_057934-058114 well that's interesting
sw02032-A_000000-000041 [noise]
sw02032-A_000041-000745 okay so we've got to talk about music [noise] and um do you like [vocalized-noise] classic rock or modern rock or which kind
sw02032-A_001154-001419 no not a seventies baby
sw02032-A_001790-002100 is it disco or is it like
sw02032-A_002100-002401 [laughter] but
sw02032-A_002738-003454 oh okay so so they can get like the doors and led zeppelin yeah that's cool and how about the rolling stones
sw02032-A_003759-004130 oh that's when that's when they took toured how about um pink floyd
sw02032-A_004130-004553 okay so so then we got we got some of the same things because
sw02032-A_004870-005928 no it's very hard because see well i mean in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen you know t- what- i listen to heavy metal or or classic rock
sw02032-A_005928-006350 we're talking about what they th- they call hard rock
sw02032-A_006615-007102 like for example let's see uh bad company what like
sw02032-A_007245-007372 well
sw02032-A_007372-007638 well they're like for example a._c. d._c.
sw02032-A_008057-008788 why have you heard of them okay and stuff like that that's that's that's not really hard rock
sw02032-A_008919-009028 okay
sw02032-A_009402-009752 well cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal
sw02032-A_010224-011001 but see for example they have see what what other bands consider it like really hard rock it's like brash metal
sw02032-A_011001-011628 which all they do is they have like this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low
sw02032-A_011628-011784 [noise]
sw02032-A_011784-012747 and what happens is ah everybody gets like totally into the music and then they start dancing around and they just bump into each other
sw02032-A_012747-013081 like like they hit each other with their shoulders
sw02032-A_013081-013863 and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
sw02032-A_014020-014260 no i don't like that music
sw02032-A_014260-015229 but that's that's what they do that's that's what some people call like really heavy metal and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also
sw02032-A_015229-016187 like really like heavy metal [vocalized-noise] considered like the words heavy metal and like they always talk about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that
sw02032-A_016187-016268 [noise]
sw02032-A_016268-017043 and just hard rock has th- they don't talk about that they just talk about like life in general like queen's reich if you ever heard of them
sw02032-A_017170-017340 so
sw02032-A_017444-017751 okay then well no i said queen's reich but
sw02032-A_017751-018212 but but oh no you got to like queen also so because
sw02032-A_018388-019421 yeah especially uh oh god what is it a. night at the opera don't they have a no let's see the one that they have the the whole opera sing in the background
sw02032-A_019421-019583 oh
sw02032-A_019583-020198 bo- bo- bohemian rhapsody yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up
sw02032-A_020198-020479 because i mean i just love that song
sw02032-A_020637-020997 yeah but they had th- that that whole record was pretty good
sw02032-A_020997-021319 but then they started going downhill like everybody else
sw02032-A_021617-022133 yeah they they're still around they got a new a new c._d. out but i d- i wouldn't buy it
sw02032-A_022133-022771 because see what happens is the oldies see what i like i like the old rolling stones i don't like the new stuff
sw02032-A_022886-023006 yeah
sw02032-A_023879-024007 yeah
sw02032-A_024007-025150 yeah well for example i used to like the old phil collins an old genesis and and then what happened was that phil collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
sw02032-A_025150-025669 and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required
sw02032-A_025669-026782 that was good but it was on it's way of going downhill because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the invisible touch with uh genesis
sw02032-A_026782-027370 and that really like now i hate phil collins i can't stand him because i look at him and i say
sw02032-A_027370-028439 you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit
sw02032-A_028439-028760 and so that's that's what gets me mad
sw02032-A_028860-029122 but did did you go see that new doors movie
sw02032-A_029490-029711 yeah i saw it when it opened
sw02032-A_029711-030531 yeah well i- it's it's uh you know it's like i was watching siskel and ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies
sw02032-A_030531-031510 and they both loved the movie right they said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that and then one of them said well everything is great but i'm gonna give it a thumbs down
sw02032-A_031510-031955 and they go but why because it's like the end is like really depressing
sw02032-A_031955-032950 and so an- but but it's like but it's like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up see i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine
sw02032-A_032950-033990 so i mean so for me no but you learn to i mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say
sw02032-A_033990-034609 i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too [laughter] you know i was like [laughter]
sw02032-A_035006-035889 hey but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants and [laughter] [laughter]
sw02032-A_036623-036756 yeah
sw02032-A_036876-037048 did did you go to college
sw02032-A_037289-037476 oh that's cool
sw02032-A_037780-037910 okay
sw02032-A_038376-038607 yeah yeah
sw02032-A_038842-038983 yeah
sw02032-A_039289-039673 well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in
sw02032-A_039673-040033 in progression ever in history
sw02032-A_040033-040324 so naw about everything
sw02032-A_040324-041050 so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies i don't know what they're called you know it's like
sw02032-A_041050-041680 like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or or you know like the technology years
sw02032-A_041680-042430 because of all the computers and stuff but the seventies got nothing [laughter] i mean nobody cared to name it [laughter] so
sw02032-A_042430-043359 yeah i know can you imagine the uh like a big picture of john travolta and saturday night what is it saturday night fever him just standing there you know
sw02032-A_043359-044217 but uh yeah that's a good example to look for in history well [vocalized-noise] from now on we're gonna go from the from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step
sw02032-A_044217-045072 on the moon to nineteen eighties okay what happened in the middle don't worry don't worry you don't you're not missing anything [vocalized-noise] so
sw02032-A_045194-045664 yeah really and that's that's why i guess everybody is yeah it's like
sw02032-A_045664-046368 they don't wanna talk about that so they just don't name it i mean it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times
sw02032-A_046579-046710 so
sw02032-A_046843-047326 oh well let's see yeah okay we've been talking for seven minutes so

sw02035-B_030570-030742 [noise]
sw02036-A_000389-000895 uh yes i- i used to work with a guy from puerto rico when i worked for hewlett packard
sw02036-A_000895-001664 [noise] and uh [noise] he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to colorado where i was living [noise]
sw02036-A_001664-002163 uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um
sw02036-A_002163-002637 the united states the the language was a little bit different although he did speak english
sw02036-A_002637-002919 it was just some of the [vocalized-noise] excuse me
sw02036-A_002919-003746 i've never been there my dad used to work for dupont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school
sw02036-A_003746-003888 yeah
sw02036-A_004208-004335 uh-huh
sw02036-A_004834-004961 uh-huh
sw02036-A_005062-005243 okay
sw02036-A_005243-005826 uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month
sw02036-A_005826-005989 and uh
sw02036-A_005989-006762 i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh
sw02036-A_006762-007674 it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't want to go because she didn't play golf or tennis [laughter] and there wasn't really a job for her there
sw02036-A_008172-008307 yeah
sw02036-A_008462-008588 uh-huh
sw02036-A_008903-009028 yeah
sw02036-A_009450-009582 right
sw02036-A_009947-010472 yeah i lived in colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great
sw02036-A_010472-010729 i go oh it was just a place to live
sw02036-A_010729-010969 yeah i was
sw02036-A_011538-012671 i- i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think um from talking to jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem um upset about it or anything and
sw02036-A_012671-013001 i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it
sw02036-A_013706-013871 yeah
sw02036-A_013871-014321 i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too good
sw02036-A_014446-015057 yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don't know
sw02036-A_015162-015521 yeah i don't know cut california in half or something
sw02036-A_015666-016391 but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff
sw02036-A_016391-017197 um and they make i guess it's no income tax there or fed- no federal income tax something like that
sw02036-A_017197-017348 yeah
sw02036-A_017522-017804 um yeah i think it's a territory
sw02036-A_017804-017989 that makes sense
sw02036-A_017989-018702 i mean there's uh lots of tiny islands in the south pacific that are territories like that they could make states like guam
sw02036-A_018702-018740 [noise]
sw02036-A_018740-018857 or uh
sw02036-A_018968-019463 yeah it's a u. s. territory and it's just we own it or
sw02036-A_019463-019618 yeah
sw02036-A_019772-020141 well hawaii is pretty far too think about it
sw02036-A_020308-020434 yeah
sw02036-A_021042-021190 yeah
sw02036-A_021190-021531 it's definitely a way out of the way where [vocalized-noise] where as
sw02036-A_021683-021830 uh-huh
sw02036-A_021830-022236 yeah where as puerto rico is pretty close by
sw02036-A_022236-022419 which
sw02036-A_022419-022547 i don't know
sw02036-A_022733-022900 [laughter]
sw02036-A_022900-023153 no i don't think they would
sw02036-A_023153-023301 yeah
sw02036-A_023301-023662 but actually i knew another guy from puerto rico that i went to school with
sw02036-A_023662-024103 and he was coming he came to america to to go to school
sw02036-A_024103-024479 and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there
sw02036-A_024479-024678 he was really funny [laughter]
sw02036-A_024678-025118 both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's uh
sw02036-A_025227-025599 if that's true about all puerto ricans or not
sw02036-A_025599-025892 ones i met have been pretty pretty funny
sw02036-A_026577-027651 yeah i don't i didn't hear any major complaints about it um [noise] i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you're a state now or you're your own country or whatever
sw02036-A_027651-027865 but um let them decide
sw02036-A_028338-028466 yeah
sw02036-A_028612-028730 yeah
sw02036-A_028730-028995 i think that makes the most sense
sw02036-A_028995-029174 hum
sw02036-A_029174-029567 okay ha- we have we been on for a long enough time
sw02036-A_029782-030295 okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so
sw02036-A_030295-030390 [noise]
sw02036-A_030390-030534 but uh

sw02036-A_030705-031019 all right well it was good talking to you becky bye-bye
sw02036-A_031019-031313 [noise]
sw02036-B_000000-000083 [noise]

sw02036-B_000844-000951 oh really
sw02036-B_001296-001420 uh-huh
sw02036-B_002558-002804 yeah have you ever been there
sw02036-B_002804-002988 have you ever been there
sw02036-B_003669-003827 really
sw02036-B_003827-004261 no i've never been there either i've not known but just a few people from there
sw02036-B_004261-004511 one uh there was a girl in
sw02036-B_004511-005084 in my flight in in uh air force basic training actually who was from there
sw02036-B_005770-005918 uh-huh
sw02036-B_006476-006625 oh yeah
sw02036-B_006625-006853 [laughter]
sw02036-B_006853-007033 it always sounds more
sw02036-B_007575-007793 oh its
sw02036-B_007793-008253 i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is
sw02036-B_008253-009504 ever- because i spent five years in europe and everybody goes oh you're so lucky and i'm like well yeah sort of you know it's but having lived there it's not it's not anything like you picture it
sw02036-B_009504-010146 you know it's not it's like i still have the fantasies about hawaii and all that stuff but
sw02036-B_010437-010850 and your just like yeah well sort of right [laughter]
sw02036-B_010850-011562 but um [noise] what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state
sw02036-B_012099-012234 yeah
sw02036-B_012949-013258 really i- i think
sw02036-B_013258-013896 i'm not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know
sw02036-B_014213-014636 [laughter] where are they going to put the other one [laughter]
sw02036-B_014799-014948 [laughter]
sw02036-B_014948-015269 well where are we where are we going to get another state
sw02036-B_015269-015477 [laughter]
sw02036-B_015477-015950 [laughter] or texas no that's not a good idea [laughter]
sw02036-B_016293-016440 oh yeah
sw02036-B_016860-017001 [noise]
sw02036-B_017001-017591 oh yeah because it's just a territory or is that what it's called a territory
sw02036-B_017769-017903 okay
sw02036-B_018853-019120 is that a u. s. territory though
sw02036-B_019367-019596 that would be kind of bizarre
sw02036-B_019596-019785 that's kind of far
sw02036-B_019785-019941 [laughter]
sw02036-B_019941-020376 well that's true but there is not a whole lot between here and there
sw02036-B_020376-021205 where you you start dealing with guam it's like you know flying over all these other places to get there
sw02036-B_021333-021420 [laughter]
sw02036-B_021420-021818 my dad was stationed in guam during the world war two though
sw02036-B_022211-022340 yeah
sw02036-B_022513-022804 of course you could annex cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit
sw02036-B_022804-023019 [laughter]
sw02036-B_023019-023240 i don't think they'd go for that
sw02036-B_023590-023723 um-hum
sw02036-B_024394-024670 oh yeah do you think
sw02036-B_024670-024846 [vocalized-noise]
sw02036-B_024846-025057 [laughter]
sw02036-B_025635-026552 no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly they're they're pretty much satisfied with things the way they are
sw02036-B_027237-027399 yeah
sw02036-B_027614-027797 exactly
sw02036-B_027797-028700 really that's why i said you know when it when when their time is right when they're ready for it you know that it will come about
sw02036-B_028888-029039 okay
sw02036-B_029039-029290 well rick it's been good talking to you
sw02036-B_029504-029968 i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don't they
sw02036-B_030277-030428 oh okay
sw02036-B_030661-030901 okay bye-bye
sw02036-B_031016-031313 [noise]
sw02038-A_000000-000099 [noise]
sw02038-A_000201-000325 yep
sw02038-A_000519-001894 i wasn't in central america but uh talking about latin america i kind of i consider latin america to include central and south america and i did live in uh sao paulo brazil for four years
sw02038-A_002236-002690 uh r- realistically i
sw02038-A_002690-003774 yes i don't see the the panama canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the
sw02038-A_003774-005111 the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh noriega in this
sw02038-A_007311-007520 uh-huh
sw02038-A_008847-009165 no i haven't
sw02038-A_013167-014255 i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i
sw02038-A_014255-015383 it it gets it g- there you you've got this this toss up bet- or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have it's it's um
sw02038-A_015383-016248 own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people and then on the other hand uh the uh
sw02038-A_016248-017629 the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts
sw02038-A_017629-018611 making overtures to the soviet union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now we're we're in this dilemma over
sw02038-A_018611-019548 uh united states is believes in democracy and and self-determination where a- but that on the other hand we believe in self-preservation and
sw02038-A_019548-020903 uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the inf- soviet influence in in what's considered to be the united states' fear of the world which is not only
sw02038-A_020903-021682 you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the united states is looks like we're it now
sw02038-A_023013-023289 um-hum
sw02038-A_025802-026014 right
sw02038-A_027715-028350 well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family
sw02038-A_030529-030926 yeah oh you can look in
sw02038-A_030926-031741 i- y- p- if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this
sw02038-A_031741-033205 uh hundreds of years of spanish control in the in the spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who
sw02038-A_033205-033370 uh have been uh
sw02038-A_033370-034580 i don't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the who- the incredibly horrible things they did to the
sw02038-A_034580-035754 uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get
sw02038-A_036780-037282 oh absolutely and n- we set up
sw02038-A_037282-038214 and i mean ted teddy roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh
sw02038-A_039052-039331 right
sw02038-A_040592-042059 i've the only the only thing i see about cuba though is uh after fidel castro dies i don't think there'll be communist power anymore i i can't see communism in that country carrying on past him
sw02038-A_044145-044371 yeah
sw02038-A_045175-045412 right
sw02038-A_045974-047335 yeah well i i don't know if maybe communism's the right the right word for it but what we would there'd have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which a- at which you've uh
sw02038-A_047335-047890 you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh
sw02038-A_047890-048863 organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
sw02038-A_049592-049758 right
sw02038-A_050017-050147 right
sw02038-A_050249-050582 but cocoa leaves sell real low right now
sw02038-A_050582-050773 it seems yeah
sw02038-A_050912-051118 absolutely
sw02038-A_051118-052153 absolutely i don't it's gonna be hard to um we've th- y- th- y- that's that's where you're absolutely right as we've got to do something in that region to encourage
sw02038-A_052153-052767 uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean
sw02038-A_053190-053338 right
sw02038-A_053541-054351 i got to watch what i say here i never know when the d._i._a. maybe uh listening on my phone [laughter] right
sw02038-A_054351-054901 yeah uh it's tempting it's got to be it's got be horribly tempting for those for those
sw02038-A_054901-055636 because yeah yeah yeah y- it's not j- it's not just a matter of uh of having an
sw02038-A_055636-056154 extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of
sw02038-A_056154-057293 of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and y- there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being able to do it a-
sw02038-A_057444-057678 oh no
sw02038-A_058433-058590 um-hum
sw02038-A_059713-059989 right
sw02038-B_000000-000068 [noise]
sw02038-B_000068-000286 okay i guess we're on
sw02038-B_000286-000577 central america have you ever lived in central america
sw02038-B_001810-002198 do you do you think that that we should have given up the panama canal
sw02038-B_004986-005732 well there are those that that that think that that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic
sw02038-B_005732-006274 importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in world war two
sw02038-B_006274-006784 and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain
sw02038-B_006784-007373 if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the panama canal he had worked with united fruit company
sw02038-B_007373-008279 there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
sw02038-B_008279-009052 and uh he turned them down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there
sw02038-B_009052-009399 it's it's really i i haven't been th- i've been to been to salvador and
sw02038-B_009399-010059 and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess
sw02038-B_010059-010689 and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite
sw02038-B_010689-011676 quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the sandinistas or
sw02038-B_011676-011956 or do we support uh
sw02038-B_011956-012622 you know when they thought uh they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
sw02038-B_012622-013225 will you uh d- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in nicaragua
sw02038-B_021670-022614 well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal but there was an option to build it across nicaragua
sw02038-B_022614-023100 uh and there were uh there's a big there's a big lake
sw02038-B_023100-024354 and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua but the the united states uh had some and i've forgotten what the political influence was
sw02038-B_024354-025202 but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if it's in the economic interest of the united states
sw02038-B_025202-026140 uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if there's no economic benefit
sw02038-B_026140-027008 and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in central america regardless of where he is
sw02038-B_027008-027909 is his life [vocalized-noise] is his life better off under communism or or uh or democratic government you look at salvador where the
sw02038-B_028265-028731 yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if they'll mostly leave him alone
sw02038-B_028731-029442 uh and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesn't make uh
sw02038-B_029442-029935 doesn't make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh
sw02038-B_029935-030830 central american leaders that uh a- are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh
sw02038-B_035538-036456 it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and americans
sw02038-B_036456-037018 have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the panama canal we went in and and took it
sw02038-B_037119-037421 and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh
sw02038-B_038026-038945 well what's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it
sw02038-B_038945-039525 the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh
sw02038-B_039525-039943 what's the what's america's role there and it it uh
sw02038-B_039943-040731 with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh cuba that exception exerts some influence
sw02038-B_042091-042520 well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in salvador
sw02038-B_042520-042881 where there is a significant u- under class
sw02038-B_042881-043012 [noise] excuse me
sw02038-B_043012-043449 and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty
sw02038-B_043449-043718 uh surviving
sw02038-B_043718-043924 uh the question is would they
sw02038-B_043924-044297 you know would they be better off under communism
sw02038-B_044297-045102 and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the
sw02038-B_045102-045773 it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the u._s. is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them
sw02038-B_045773-046051 uh you know communism would feed them all
sw02038-B_048605-048768 well that
sw02038-B_048768-049510 yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know i- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas
sw02038-B_049510-050401 to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him
sw02038-B_050560-050761 [laughter] yes [laughter]
sw02038-B_050761-051259 a- as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
sw02038-B_052692-053437 yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
sw02038-B_053437-053639 well not that we could be bought but uh
sw02038-B_053863-054272 well of course all everything we're saying is being recorded and [laughter]
sw02038-B_054272-054385 [laughter]
sw02038-B_054385-054556 of course of course
sw02038-B_054942-055120 particularly if you're hungry
sw02038-B_057237-057847 [vocalized-noise] uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and
sw02038-B_057847-058274 you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when
sw02038-B_058274-059078 when the uh religious organizations you know the catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people
sw02038-B_059078-059327 and help them protect themselves no- not that they
sw02038-B_059327-059848 i'm i'm not sure the catholic church is is is p- particularly political but
sw02038-B_059848-059989 you know if somebody's hun-
sw02039-A_001549-001899 oh yes yes very much
sw02039-A_001899-002370 as a matter of fact i prefer public television
sw02039-A_002370-002950 and uh i have particularly enjoy the
sw02039-A_002950-003226 english comedies
sw02039-A_003226-003476 and the
sw02039-A_003476-003649 english mysteries
sw02039-A_004149-004299 yes
sw02039-A_004699-004873 vociferously
sw02039-A_005425-005550 yes
sw02039-A_006400-007375 well unfortunately for us at least here in the united states we the only access we have to that of course is public television
sw02039-A_007375-007996 and i i'm not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh
sw02039-A_007996-008157 the
sw02039-A_008157-008498 watching what i do watch is uh
sw02039-A_008498-009174 usually news and whatever is on public television uh any kind of i also uh
sw02039-A_009174-009648 am very fond of great performances in in that regard
sw02039-A_009648-009809 but uh
sw02039-A_010227-010695 no uh no uh no as a matter of fact
sw02039-A_010695-011048 uh turner broadcasting
sw02039-A_011048-011549 has been uh broadcasting
sw02039-A_011549-011869 all of the james bond movies
sw02039-A_011869-012769 every night this week so i have concentrated on watching james bond movies [laughter] this week [laughter]
sw02039-A_013316-014346 well they're showing uh live and let die at this moment and it is the first appearance of roger moore as 007
sw02039-A_014346-014548 so it it
sw02039-A_014548-015919 no no that's true i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies whereas uh sean connery has maintained the
sw02039-A_015919-016499 i how would you ruddy uh look uh but uh
sw02039-A_016499-016748 oh yes yes
sw02039-A_017542-017862 [laughter] well you know he was uh

sw02039-A_024148-024274 um-hum
sw02039-A_025208-025356 yeah
sw02039-A_025356-025584 yeah i know well i i'd
sw02039-A_025584-026296 i as i said i'm not much of a television watcher i read as i said and uh quite a bit i i read about
sw02039-A_026296-026514 two or three novels a week
sw02039-A_026514-027078 in addition to all the technical stuff what d- what what do you do what kind of work do you do
sw02039-A_027374-027532 at t._i.
sw02039-A_028122-028323 oh i see
sw02039-A_028323-028870 um-hum well the last two people who have called both worked for t._i. and i just wondered huh
sw02039-A_029356-029522 um-hum
sw02039-A_029522-030067 [laughter] i guess yeah i- i guess we all can
sw02039-A_030245-030494 no no i work for g._t._e.
sw02039-A_030494-030684 in maryland yes
sw02039-A_030895-031170 well that i guess it it doe-
sw02039-A_031170-032153 how did i hear about it well i work you know they're gathering a database for voice processing and that's my field of of work also
sw02039-A_032153-033105 so i i know the people at t._i. who are doing this and i heard about it so i called them and ask if i c- could participate and uh
sw02039-A_033105-033459 you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth
sw02039-A_033459-033970 we could go back to television shows if you
sw02039-A_034397-034556 yes i have
sw02039-A_035446-035800 well no that's it you could interpret it that way
sw02039-A_035800-035932 uh
sw02039-A_035932-036070 i think
sw02039-A_036070-036473 what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of
sw02039-A_036473-036664 historical truth
sw02039-A_036792-037075 but the interpretation that
sw02039-A_037075-037336 actually got into the um
sw02039-A_037336-037725 the writing of the bible itself is probably
sw02039-A_037725-038446 uh after the what uh was it the king james version when the committee
sw02039-A_038446-038595 uh
sw02039-A_038595-039799 did it wr- wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the tr- most of the translations were from greek
sw02039-A_039799-040576 uh well for example uh in greek there are seven different words for love
sw02039-A_040576-041677 okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one ler word for you know l- uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing
sw02039-A_041677-042268 so in those tr- those types of interpretations uh
sw02039-A_042268-043463 really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical
sw02039-A_043463-043692 fact involved just from the
sw02039-A_043692-044166 uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available
sw02039-A_044166-044871 to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it
sw02039-A_044871-045321 you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that
sw02039-A_045321-045725 it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way
sw02039-A_045923-046944 yeah hey you could well you can interpret that the what the t._v. show in the same way you can interpret the bible well uh so
sw02039-A_046944-047852 but uh i as as far as that goes i a- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh
sw02039-A_047852-048298 i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh
sw02039-A_048298-048724 i think so too all right well it's been very pleasant talking to you

sw02039-B_004811-005770 okay well that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books and the plots are more

sw02039-B_049107-049327 [noise]
sw02040-A_000000-000152 [noise]
sw02040-A_000152-001138 yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
sw02040-A_005459-005768 well i'm i guess
sw02040-A_005768-006508 i don't have su- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
sw02040-A_006508-007800 um my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low st- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
sw02040-A_007800-008961 um part of this i suppose is justified in i- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th- the more northern territories need
sw02040-A_008961-009484 however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
sw02040-A_009484-010066 i have been to puerto rico and and found it very very interesting i did peace corps training there
sw02040-A_010066-011337 and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california and so the spanish was no problem
sw02040-A_011337-011570 um it was
sw02040-A_011570-012448 it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
sw02040-A_012448-013073 a girl from puerto rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
sw02040-A_013073-013222 uh
sw02040-A_014257-014632 well probably more on in terms of the u._s.
sw02040-A_014632-014791 um
sw02040-A_014791-015205 you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the u._s. copes
sw02040-A_015205-015644 with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so
sw02040-A_015644-016391 i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in lebanon so i was very cut off from the
sw02040-A_016391-016640 the press as i w- you know
sw02040-A_016640-017268 and uh bec- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the u._s. would cope with it a
sw02040-A_017268-017705 new state that is so very very poor
sw02040-A_017705-018388 um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
sw02040-A_018388-019422 like new york and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
sw02040-A_020399-020584 i think so
sw02040-A_022248-022412 um-hum
sw02040-A_029954-030480 um-hum yeah th- those are good points um which obviously i'd never thought about
sw02040-A_030480-030617 um
sw02040-A_030617-031000 i don't know wh- uh i suppose
sw02040-A_031000-031344 they also not being a state are
sw02040-A_031344-031719 probably freer to determine their own
sw02040-A_031719-032161 um ways of life than they would if if
sw02040-A_032161-032874 i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
sw02040-A_032874-033151 perhaps compulsory education
sw02040-A_033315-033458 um
sw02040-A_033458-033710 and taxes [laughter]
sw02040-A_038136-039007 um-hum w- well actually i thin- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
sw02040-A_039007-039694 they've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
sw02040-A_039694-040032 so if they've just taken such action
sw02040-A_040032-040799 it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
sw02040-A_040799-041142 to declare this before they become a state
sw02040-A_041142-041998 or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
sw02040-A_042775-043178 i i believe i would probably tend towards that
sw02040-A_044494-044679 well that's interesting
sw02040-A_045005-045752 right what about if if um they demanded to have spanish as the official language
sw02040-A_045752-046025 as a condition for statehood
sw02040-A_048892-049027 um-hum
sw02040-A_050523-050661 um
sw02040-A_052695-052880 um-hum um-hum
sw02040-A_052996-053198 that's interesting because
sw02040-A_053198-053669 although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience
sw02040-A_053669-053848 uh
sw02040-A_053848-054337 i was in bilingual education in california and
sw02040-A_054337-054653 i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
sw02040-A_054653-055052 my brother wh- who was uh quite a bit younger
sw02040-A_055052-055513 was learning spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
sw02040-A_055513-055896 and so obviously it didn't work in california
sw02040-A_056094-056231 right
sw02040-A_056669-056799 right
sw02040-A_057332-057531 oh i see
sw02040-A_058018-058188 um-hum um-hum
sw02040-A_058580-058834 o- okay well thank you very much
sw02040-A_058834-058967 bye-bye
sw02040-A_058967-059116 [noise]
sw02040-B_000000-000114 [noise]
sw02040-B_001089-001238 i was a
sw02040-B_001238-002266 resident although very young of the s- of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty nine when alaska stopped being a territory became a state
sw02040-B_002266-002612 uh so i guess i have a left over
sw02040-B_002612-003223 positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about puerto rico
sw02040-B_003223-004236 um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive uh and i k- have a suspicion that that i
sw02040-B_004236-005305 believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
sw02040-B_005305-005538 what is your situation
sw02040-B_009981-010168 oh that's very interesting
sw02040-B_013112-014342 your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on puerto rico or pressures on the u._s. in terms of aid or
sw02040-B_016893-017027 um-hum
sw02040-B_017604-017737 um-hum
sw02040-B_019356-019505 i guess
sw02040-B_019505-019629 um
sw02040-B_019629-020501 we're assuming that that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say mississippi or
sw02040-B_020501-020652 okay
sw02040-B_020652-021125 that's something th- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
sw02040-B_021125-021961 than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
sw02040-B_021961-022888 pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have
sw02040-B_022888-023043 um
sw02040-B_023043-023752 i don't know whether state woul- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the ve- the act of being a state
sw02040-B_023752-024889 would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
sw02040-B_024889-025109 i don't know if they suffer
sw02040-B_025109-025290 in a sense of
sw02040-B_025290-026320 income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
sw02040-B_026320-026520 how do you feel though about
sw02040-B_026520-027860 well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how hav- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the s- in the
sw02040-B_027860-028191 alaska at the time since th- they voted absentee
sw02040-B_028191-028698 i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- feeling of second class citizenry
sw02040-B_028698-029469 uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
sw02040-B_029469-029801 in their not having a senate representative
sw02040-B_032813-032961 um-hum
sw02040-B_033146-033386 uh i see what you mean so that
sw02040-B_033607-034504 yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
sw02040-B_034504-034654 um
sw02040-B_034654-036098 frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
sw02040-B_036223-037008 um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy
sw02040-B_037008-037144 uh
sw02040-B_037144-037474 i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
sw02040-B_037474-038237 realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the u._s. than an independent country
sw02040-B_038237-038361 so
sw02040-B_039624-039774 um-hum
sw02040-B_041562-041704 [noise]
sw02040-B_041920-042039 uh-huh
sw02040-B_042039-042172 that's interesting
sw02040-B_042367-042813 well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
sw02040-B_043150-044447 and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ult- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
sw02040-B_044547-044732 at this point
sw02040-B_044732-044981 leaning towards uh statehood
sw02040-B_046137-047613 i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou- against that decision even if uh louisiana chose to go with creole or something
sw02040-B_047613-047733 um
sw02040-B_047733-049171 i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-
sw02040-B_049171-050557 am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
sw02040-B_050557-051417 and canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be
sw02040-B_051417-051886 a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
sw02040-B_051886-051998 um
sw02040-B_051998-052775 i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect
sw02040-B_055454-055578 hum
sw02040-B_055793-055903 yeah
sw02040-B_055903-056750 but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
sw02040-B_056750-057427 but i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
sw02040-B_057581-057702 um
sw02040-B_057702-058104 i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
sw02040-B_058307-058703 well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
sw02040-B_058815-058940 good-bye
sw02040-B_059086-059116 [noise]
sw02041-A_000000-000098 [noise]
sw02041-A_000098-000721 uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes [noise]
sw02041-A_000946-001087 uh-huh
sw02041-A_001857-002009 um-hum
sw02041-A_002434-002616 um-hum you're a student
sw02041-A_002616-002744 uh-huh
sw02041-A_003530-003707 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_003869-004527 um i'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise i
sw02041-A_004527-004791 i don't feel like i
sw02041-A_004791-006013 i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things
sw02041-A_006013-006595 like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time
sw02041-A_006595-007135 but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh
sw02041-A_007251-007358 you know
sw02041-A_007358-007973 mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person
sw02041-A_007973-009379 but it's not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
sw02041-A_009693-009796 um-hum
sw02041-A_009943-010044 um-hum
sw02041-A_010167-010368 yes yes
sw02041-A_011378-011593 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_011889-012017 um-hum
sw02041-A_012017-012201 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_012679-013423 yeah yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because you're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore
sw02041-A_013586-013728 yeah
sw02041-A_014057-014389 yeah would that we could [laughter]
sw02041-A_014694-014894 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_015561-015731 yeah
sw02041-A_015731-015893 um-hum
sw02041-A_016243-016456 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_016456-017066 right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
sw02041-A_018410-018568 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_018848-018999 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_019284-019460 um-hum
sw02041-A_019460-019615 um-hum
sw02041-A_020148-020956 hm well you're talking to someone from california where it's often swimming weather [laughter]
sw02041-A_021081-021306 uh
sw02041-A_021437-022727 [laughter] so it's the it's it's the the act- well it's actually it's interesting because there are rea- real regional differences um in california there's uh almost an assumption
sw02041-A_022727-022836 um
sw02041-A_022836-023092 unless you're sort of clearly of an
sw02041-A_023092-023564 uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm
sw02041-A_023564-024689 i'm not uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban california and maybe not i don't know about rural california too well but in urban california it's just
sw02041-A_024689-025289 you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here
sw02041-A_025289-026490 and before that there was the running craze and they california gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh [noise]
sw02041-A_027905-028056 um-hum
sw02041-A_028425-028554 yeah
sw02041-A_029389-030169 well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of uh you know you'll get
sw02041-A_030169-030994 organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the uni- uni- uni- the university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter
sw02041-A_030994-031351 which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter
sw02041-A_031351-031695 monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and
sw02041-A_031695-032226 and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's
sw02041-A_032226-033501 on fairly s- solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says ev- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together
sw02041-A_033501-034182 and uh so it's had that orientation for quite sometime um there's been some progressive medical schools out here
sw02041-A_034182-034542 that have taken that approach and um
sw02041-A_035756-037130 boy yeah that there's a i- i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
sw02041-A_037130-037367 yeah and s-
sw02041-A_038031-038229 yeah yeah exactly
sw02041-A_038229-039564 and part of it is california you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was
sw02041-A_039564-039801 um people becoming interested in alternate
sw02041-A_039801-040188 practices i don't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know
sw02041-A_040188-041256 which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh a._m._a. approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and
sw02041-A_041256-041974 and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long
sw02041-A_041974-042653 you you get this this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options
sw02041-A_042653-043040 and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them
sw02041-A_043040-043595 the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented
sw02041-A_043595-043720 towards
sw02041-A_043720-045031 doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me
sw02041-A_045683-046266 oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise [laughter]
sw02041-A_046403-046542 um-hum
sw02041-A_047698-048508 yeah well i- i think so i mean you you've if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about
sw02041-A_048508-049937 people who were considered very healthy in china and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and
sw02041-A_049937-051194 they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know and that that's
sw02041-A_051194-052161 and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um
sw02041-A_052599-052969 yes as am i actually i as am i
sw02041-A_052969-053240 yes [laughter]
sw02041-A_053737-054449 it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
sw02041-A_054449-054861 well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will
sw02041-A_054861-054995 you can
sw02041-A_055375-056001 i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in texas and and and uh it occurred to me
sw02041-A_056212-056313 um-hum
sw02041-A_056896-057041 um-hum um-hum
sw02041-A_057218-057351 yeah
sw02041-A_057603-057805 yeah yeah
sw02041-A_058614-058762 yeah
sw02041-A_059418-059639 um-hum um-hum um-hum
sw02041-B_000000-000099 [noise]
sw02041-B_000457-001195 wh- um well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class he's an aerobics instructor
sw02041-B_001195-001881 and um is going to be uh entering north texas for a kinesiology program there
sw02041-B_001881-002576 and um [noise] the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach
sw02041-B_002576-003630 yeah so i'm i'm an avid aerobics [noise] uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports
sw02041-B_003630-003916 so and how do you feel about it [laughter]
sw02041-B_006520-006670 um-hum
sw02041-B_008781-008886 um-hum
sw02041-B_009148-010561 yeah well i i've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore
sw02041-B_010561-010902 so um and i feel that way too as far as
sw02041-B_010902-011440 y- you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to
sw02041-B_011440-012349 you know a a calc- you know calculated down and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but i do try and um
sw02041-B_012349-012796 i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week
sw02041-B_013241-013344 yeah
sw02041-B_013344-013676 and it's got and i've always enjoyed dance
sw02041-B_013676-014089 so it involves you know i- i can't get out to dance all the time
sw02041-B_014089-015168 and yeah [laughter] and it's and it's more regulated i mean you're you're using different parts of the body so it it is like dance an- and it's structured like
sw02041-B_015168-015809 that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me
sw02041-B_015809-016646 and someone else is telling me okay you know l- let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
sw02041-B_016978-017423 yeah yeah but i'm like you i also um
sw02041-B_017423-018684 like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh myerson symphony run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and um
sw02041-B_018684-020050 just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and i- i- i love to swim so i love it when you know it's
sw02041-B_020050-020289 swimming weather and uh
sw02041-B_020450-021357 oh i didn't realize that i'm sorry well i'm in texas i- i just assumed that i had this is the first call i've done and i didn't realize that they had were going to
sw02041-B_021357-021664 reach out to people from all over the country
sw02041-B_021664-021932 you wouldn't know that [laughter] oh i
sw02041-B_025700-025828 um-hum
sw02041-B_026445-026748 well i think people are are more enc-
sw02041-B_026748-027615 people from california seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just
sw02041-B_027615-028692 y- y- your health consciousness and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of california not just exercise but health health related
sw02041-B_028692-029235 ideas and i i- it's curious i don't know why don't know if it's
sw02041-B_029235-029579 [vocalized-noise] do you does california have a
sw02041-B_031336-031527 um-hum
sw02041-B_034106-034233 um-hum
sw02041-B_034431-034882 now do you think that's because they've realized that
sw02041-B_034882-035748 for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
sw02041-B_035748-036010 do you think the program came first or the [laughter]
sw02041-B_036958-038244 yeah the more money they put into it i can see that because i knowing from institutes of [vocalized-noise] learning like that i know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so
sw02041-B_041735-041845 um-hum
sw02041-B_042560-042681 um-hum
sw02041-B_044604-044720 yeah
sw02041-B_044720-046160 or they're older well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- i- i- i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the
sw02041-B_046160-047519 it's it's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um [noise] almost you know doesn't worry about it to such a degree but
sw02041-B_047519-047916 stays you know more healthier you know as a fit person
sw02041-B_049742-049875 um-hum
sw02041-B_050967-051478 yeah well don't you think a lot of that is diet too yeah
sw02041-B_051688-051797 um-hum
sw02041-B_052061-052951 yeah and as we can see well i'm a i'm a practicing vegetarian so uh i've read a lot of information knowing that to be true what's that [noise]
sw02041-B_052951-053921 oh are you also [laughter] well that's that's good as far as the cal- is that is that um pretty predominant as far as california do do
sw02041-B_053921-054046 in the urban areas
sw02041-B_054425-054622 um-hum oh that's wonderful
sw02041-B_054809-055424 yeah that's great i mean we uh it's such a tr- it's such a trouble here i mean you just have to eat at home basically
sw02041-B_055797-056534 well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to dallas so um which
sw02041-B_056534-057023 y- you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so
sw02041-B_057023-058360 you're gonna have a lot of [vocalized-noise] more choices but in urban areas it's you know steak places an and it's not a you know it's uh [noise] definitely it it's it's changing to a degree but
sw02041-B_058360-059223 um [noise] it's very frustrating and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh
sw02041-B_059223-059862 organic you know materials and foods and things you don't really have that i mean you would think
sw02044-A_000109-000893 i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter
sw02044-A_000893-001663 uh [vocalized-noise] we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one
sw02044-A_001663-002436 um course i've only lived here three years but uh but that i- still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm
sw02044-A_003186-003561 yeah yeah yeah
sw02044-A_004081-004209 yeah
sw02044-A_004840-004983 yeah
sw02044-A_005651-005996 oh [laughter]
sw02044-A_006730-006856 yeah
sw02044-A_007431-007923 right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in lubbock
sw02044-A_008364-008509 uh-huh
sw02044-A_008916-009104 wow yeah
sw02044-A_010469-011128 dust storms whoa [laughter] yeah
sw02044-A_011415-011543 huh
sw02044-A_012162-012817 well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven
sw02044-A_012817-013428 and uh we when we lef- we moved from new hampshire where it was snowing
sw02044-A_013428-014811 [noise] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm
sw02044-A_014811-015689 uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather
sw02044-A_015689-016397 and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in new hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um
sw02044-A_016397-017257 uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it
sw02044-A_017257-018057 and but you al- you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm
sw02044-A_018057-018854 um y- the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year
sw02044-A_019243-020044 it it uh w- it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass
sw02044-A_020044-020694 you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um
sw02044-A_021065-021398 [laughter]
sw02044-A_021694-021832 yeah
sw02044-A_022125-022265 yeah
sw02044-A_022563-022737 oh
sw02044-A_023138-023276 sure
sw02044-A_023412-023621 [laughter]
sw02044-A_023971-024239 right yeah
sw02044-A_024680-024857 right
sw02044-A_024857-025392 [laughter] well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh j- we just
sw02044-A_025392-026616 you know in up in new england you had more winter than you had a s- summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um [noise]
sw02044-A_026616-027896 we cou- you cou- uh in new england it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in march it ju- in march is is just when things
sw02044-A_027896-029031 start uh approaching the fifty degree mark a- course we've already had eighty degree weather here and d- day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think
sw02044-A_029269-029981 [noise] oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in september it would start getting cold in september
sw02044-A_030426-031279 there could be yeah there could be a- and it came i mean i used to i used to work in boston which was an hour and a half away
sw02044-A_031279-031923 and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway
sw02044-A_031923-032203 and that's so i could leave by seven
sw02044-A_032203-032933 and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then i'd sitting in that car for an hour an a half
sw02044-A_032933-033564 and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work
sw02044-A_033564-033987 so and so now it takes me ten minutes [laughter]
sw02044-A_033987-034149 oh yeah
sw02044-A_034272-034384 [noise]
sw02044-A_034625-035666 uh well they not they didn't expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and y- the schools well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the streets
sw02044-A_035666-036354 they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here
sw02044-A_036354-036839 if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the
sw02044-A_036839-037471 right right you know you y- you'd you get the first you know the f- first ice
sw02044-A_037471-037834 uh storm and the place closes up
sw02044-A_037937-038104 yes uh-huh
sw02044-A_038657-038798 yeah
sw02044-A_038929-040219 [laughter] there's nobody there yeah yeah i that happens a lot i- i just live ten minutes away and i don't w- i don't work in the at the dallas site i work at the spring creek site which is which is in plano
sw02044-A_040219-040820 and uh and so i usually i can usually make it in it's just a hop jump and a
sw02044-A_040820-041878 uh whatever the expression is i'm i'm real close [laughter] right [laughter] um but uh yeah i'd i'd hate to have to get it go to dall- drive into dallas when the weather's like that
sw02044-A_042357-043141 oh yeah oh yeah well it's like i keep telling people you don't have to shovel sunshine you know it's uh it's uh
sw02044-A_043141-044108 it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about new england you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big
sw02044-A_044108-045481 you know thick trees we used to have in new england and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres of land and um
sw02044-A_045481-046447 and so we that now we have this we have a house that's three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot you know and uh and uh
sw02044-A_046447-047703 that's right and uh so we kind of i- it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we c- oh the weather's been wonderful
sw02044-A_048001-048281 oh ye- yeah
sw02044-A_048439-048576 yeah
sw02044-A_049175-050038 yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the air's real brisk and the
sw02044-A_050038-051285 the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i- i keep i'm [laughter] i get homesick thinking about it you know [laughter]
sw02044-A_051658-052574 oh yeah humid very humid in new england i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean i- in in like in the boston area i boston's right on the water
sw02044-A_052574-053364 and uh you'd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just o- hundred percent and it was stifling
sw02044-A_053364-054326 uh here y- in in dallas in the dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but it's not nearly as bad you ge- you get a lot of dry days too
sw02044-A_055105-055527 is it [laughter] is it okay
sw02044-A_055694-055825 yeah
sw02044-A_055926-056065 okay
sw02044-A_056282-056486 oh
sw02044-A_056486-056726 [laughter]
sw02044-A_056893-057031 yeah
sw02044-A_057031-057530 yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because i grew up on the east coast
sw02044-A_057530-058412 and uh i'm originally from virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity
sw02044-A_058412-058671 and compared to the humidity here
sw02044-A_058671-060072 you know in fact uh whenever i think about mo- you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here
sw02044-B_002464-003594 my husband's been in dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad lubbock
sw02044-B_003594-004927 we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with
sw02044-B_004927-005347 uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed
sw02044-B_005347-006035 any of the real bad weather this year because we went to california instead [laughter] but right now
sw02044-B_006035-006872 um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're try- it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either
sw02044-B_006872-007588 uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere
sw02044-B_007880-008562 well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh
sw02044-B_008562-009991 pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were
sw02044-B_009991-010593 uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street
sw02044-B_010593-011494 that dust yeah [laughter] not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years
sw02044-B_011494-012002 so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but
sw02044-B_012002-012308 i guess i can live with it [laughter]
sw02044-B_012763-012893 um-hum
sw02044-B_013359-013537 um-hum
sw02044-B_015580-015777 that's true
sw02044-B_015897-016034 [laughter]
sw02044-B_016173-016368 [laughter]
sw02044-B_018759-019344 well now does dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm
sw02044-B_019975-020164 okay
sw02044-B_020650-021794 well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand lubbock texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees
sw02044-B_021794-022219 came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter
sw02044-B_022219-023057 and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again
sw02044-B_023057-024193 uh it was beautiful but that's about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind
sw02044-B_024193-024965 but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming [laughter]
sw02044-B_025978-026111 um-hum
sw02044-B_028581-028751 yeah
sw02044-B_029036-029470 well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer
sw02044-B_029926-030537 now was there actually snow on the ground all th- that time from september through what march
sw02044-B_030537-030751 oh goodness
sw02044-B_031217-031371 uh-huh
sw02044-B_031852-032029 oh
sw02044-B_032163-032377 [laughter]
sw02044-B_033512-033736 oh my goodness
sw02044-B_033736-034748 well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or
sw02044-B_035044-035206 yeah
sw02044-B_036709-037088 everything stops yeah
sw02044-B_037764-038011 well now do you work at t._i.
sw02044-B_038011-039239 i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work [laughter]
sw02044-B_039985-040137 oh okay
sw02044-B_040901-041236 [laughter] hop skip and a jump there you go
sw02044-B_041386-041560 well that's good
sw02044-B_041728-042652 well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that you're getting in dallas over your years in new hampshire or do you miss the winters or
sw02044-B_042913-043036 [laughter]
sw02044-B_044677-044820 oh my goodness
sw02044-B_046194-046580 sure once you're out of the house you're in the street
sw02044-B_047626-048142 [noise] that's good i did go up to new england one time during their fall season when the weather was just
sw02044-B_048142-049383 you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh
sw02044-B_051004-051828 uh-oh well what about your summers in dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the new england states like it is down there
sw02044-B_052328-052457 yeah
sw02044-B_054207-055038 well so that's really no big t- i tell you what that's funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to dallas in the summer
sw02044-B_055038-056049 is stifling humidity to me because lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's
sw02044-B_056049-057183 you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again
sw02044-B_057183-057370 yeah
sw02044-B_057487-057608 oh
sw02044-B_058353-058494 yeah

sw02045-A_001982-002195 i didn't think of working out as a hobby
sw02045-A_002195-002226 [laughter]
sw02045-A_002226-002548 or playing with the computer i do both at home

sw02045-A_006808-007354 then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know it's like a big ogen oven
sw02045-A_007354-007987 and uh when you pull it out it's called bisque uh it started it off with greenware
sw02045-A_007987-008419 when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it
sw02045-A_008563-008774 no i've uh
sw02045-A_008900-010021 y- you can rent people's kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted
sw02045-A_010751-011242 the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy
sw02045-A_011242-012127 now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i'd say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they're no no
sw02045-A_012127-012673 thirty two pieces is a was co- cost me about eight dollars
sw02045-A_012834-013924 no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to
sw02045-A_013924-014247 get parts that had big spaces in them
sw02045-A_014247-014684 uh couldn't do the fine -tailed fine detail on it

sw02045-A_016289-016959 a- that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them
sw02045-A_017233-017762 yeah well i didn't get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him

sw02050-A_004778-006231 in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh
sw02050-A_006231-006842 a lot of times in the summer i'll try to uh like on a friday i'll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf
sw02050-A_006842-007645 so uh i'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that's okay that's appropriate
sw02050-A_008179-009373 not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh
sw02050-A_009373-010102 is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh

sw02050-A_013780-014799 and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that l- little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way
sw02050-A_016002-016190 oh i see
sw02050-A_017213-017373 exactly
sw02050-A_018229-018602 oh lord and down in houston it'd be so hot yeah
sw02050-A_018940-019076 right
sw02050-A_019180-019334 i see
sw02050-A_019790-019928 right
sw02050-A_020570-020741 right
sw02050-A_020741-020944 i see
sw02050-A_021136-021345 right right
sw02050-A_021447-021777 and i think clothing you know i- it just uh
sw02050-A_021777-023276 it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so y- you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh
sw02050-A_023276-023860 a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude
sw02050-A_024433-024585 i see
sw02050-A_025044-025299 i'm i'm sure that's true yeah
sw02050-A_025529-025673 right
sw02050-A_025777-026482 yeah see the winter season's just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh
sw02050-A_026482-026853 in the the heavier heavier materials
sw02050-A_027532-027662 right
sw02050-A_027933-028220 exactly exactly
sw02050-A_028850-028987 right
sw02050-A_029521-030154 and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men's clothing
sw02050-A_030154-031193 because uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats ne- nearly all year round
sw02050-A_031193-032360 and uh ladies you know uh uh i don't know if that's marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer
sw02050-A_032808-032947 true
sw02050-A_033446-033589 right
sw02050-A_034734-034871 right
sw02050-A_035029-035194 exactly
sw02050-A_035194-036489 plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a h- all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it's
sw02050-A_036489-037619 uh is it after uh labor day or something i don't know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress
sw02050-A_038194-038602 i'm not for sure it's that one in september is when you need to quit
sw02050-A_038602-038792 yeah [laughter]
sw02050-A_038792-038945 right
sw02050-A_039657-039850 i see right
sw02050-A_040086-040356 exactly exactly
sw02050-A_040356-040580 [laughter]
sw02050-A_041336-042269 exac- a lot more uh that's right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance
sw02050-A_042761-042914 right
sw02050-A_042914-043221 i live here in plano yeah
sw02050-A_043696-043845 [laughter]
sw02050-A_044469-044623 oh really
sw02050-A_044623-044754 huh
sw02050-A_044953-045092 yeah
sw02050-A_045519-045665 right
sw02050-A_045948-046419 exactly and i think that's you know a north dallas type attitude
sw02050-A_046419-047558 and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in north dallas going to church
sw02050-A_047558-047709 and uh
sw02050-A_047709-048352 i don't know that's that's uh because i i went to school wi- at uh texas tech in lubbock
sw02050-A_048352-049238 and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it's like going to a fashion show almost
sw02050-A_050428-050831 right to try to keep up with the jones almost yeah
sw02050-A_050996-051141 right
sw02050-A_051489-051851 you can't just wear your sweats and an old t-shirt and
sw02050-A_051851-052002 [laughter]
sw02050-A_052002-052141 right
sw02050-A_052651-052781 [vocalized-noise]
sw02050-A_053061-053228 [laughter]
sw02050-A_053228-053779 well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call
sw02050-A_053881-054026 you too bye-bye
sw02050-A_054026-054274 [noise]
sw02050-B_000000-000544 well i haven't uh i've been working in my own home for just um
sw02050-B_000544-001655 about the last three years bu- so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i t- taught at the university of houston and um
sw02050-B_001655-001897 so i tried to wear things that were
sw02050-B_001897-002408 comfortable but still tried to look you know [vocalized-noise]
sw02050-B_002408-003733 yes bu- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn't have as good control over the class
sw02050-B_003733-004156 and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike
sw02050-B_004505-004658 um-hum
sw02050-B_005238-005381 uh-huh
sw02050-B_006802-007037 oh that's nice [laughter]
sw02050-B_007600-007789 well do you um
sw02050-B_007789-008280 meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or
sw02050-B_009007-009152 um-hum
sw02050-B_011357-012677 well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they're wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too
sw02050-B_013643-013855 um-hum um-hum
sw02050-B_014753-015572 well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um
sw02050-B_015572-016379 that because i taught english as a second language so i didn't have your average freshman student and um so i
sw02050-B_016379-017304 i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be their equal
sw02050-B_017304-018389 and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to w- park pretty far away from
sw02050-B_018501-019244 yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large
sw02050-B_019244-019640 so i preferred slacks and um you know
sw02050-B_019640-019878 kind of dressy shirts and things but
sw02050-B_019878-020800 so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and
sw02050-B_020900-021211 didn't make me have um to much trouble and
sw02050-B_021211-021486 [noise] with the students
sw02050-B_022242-022388 um-hum
sw02050-B_023833-025215 well and i i noticed since we moved down here to texas my husband is originally from texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to
sw02050-B_025215-025777 totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and
sw02050-B_025777-025907 and
sw02050-B_026805-027606 no and you don't um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater
sw02050-B_027606-028138 or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with
sw02050-B_028138-028454 different shoes you know we always had like um
sw02050-B_028454-028612 higher
sw02050-B_028612-029126 higher shoes higher tops on them rather than just um the lower
sw02050-B_029126-029554 skimm- skimmers i think they call them that you would wear day-to-day but
sw02050-B_031140-031273 um-hum
sw02050-B_032336-032610 that's really true a lot of it is um
sw02050-B_032610-033014 the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable
sw02050-B_033014-033552 you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather [laughter]
sw02050-B_033552-034000 and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and
sw02050-B_034000-034244 i guess part of that is um
sw02050-B_034244-035076 just the physics of it that in what isn't it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so
sw02050-B_036527-036650 [laughter]
sw02050-B_036814-036951 um-hum
sw02050-B_037585-038315 that's true there's some rule that's like between labor day uh no is it labor day or memorial day
sw02050-B_038551-039485 uh-huh right and the one that's like in may you can only wear and and supposedly we don't have an opportunity my husband and i we don't go to a lot of like where you have to wear
sw02050-B_039485-040266 a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two
sw02050-B_040266-040871 holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society
sw02050-B_040871-041384 go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about [laughter]
sw02050-B_041713-041875 um-hum
sw02050-B_042052-042211 yes
sw02050-B_042211-043047 i noticed uh when we moved to plano that um the mall here collin creek mall i don't know where you are but um
sw02050-B_043047-043535 oh you do that there there is a pretty um
sw02050-B_043535-044671 i wouldn't say snobbish [laughter] but it it's kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i'm wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since
sw02050-B_044671-045298 uh where you know from where i've lived in houston that you have to in order to get
sw02050-B_045298-045610 the attention you might need help
sw02050-B_045610-046208 you need to be you can't just come in off the street is what i'm trying to say [laughter]
sw02050-B_046340-046488 oh is it
sw02050-B_046863-047001 um-hum
sw02050-B_048280-048427 um-hum
sw02050-B_049163-049736 yes i think i think your right i've noticed that too it's just it's very different but i've
sw02050-B_049736-050055 i think um it's kind of sad when you have to
sw02050-B_050055-050592 go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop
sw02050-B_050592-050714 [laughter]
sw02050-B_050714-051645 yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything
sw02050-B_051645-051820 no
sw02050-B_051820-052845 you can't just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation we've had about clothing i know i've it's interesting to hear a man's point of view it's usually my husband
sw02050-B_052845-053378 he's got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes [laughter] and they magically [laughter]
sw02050-B_053708-054065 well thank you and you have a good day okay bye-bye
sw02050-B_054065-054274 [noise]

sw02051-A_000509-000997 i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place
sw02051-A_000997-001408 uh it's about thirty miles from sherman
sw02051-A_001565-001821 it's north of sherman
sw02051-A_001982-002214 uh it not too far [laughter]
sw02051-A_002627-002811 huh
sw02051-A_002973-003312 uh i've been through there
sw02051-A_003312-004760 okay oh yeah i had been through saint joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
sw02051-A_005962-006091 um-hum
sw02051-A_006957-007116 oh yeah
sw02051-A_007116-007249 sure

sw02051-A_020620-020765 uh-huh
sw02051-A_021565-022664 hum so you're you're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know
sw02051-A_022664-023404 yeah to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh
sw02051-A_024103-024225 oh
sw02051-A_024507-024648 um-hum
sw02051-A_024648-024822 um-hum

sw02051-A_048501-049288 if they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school you know it really is
sw02051-A_049398-049639 and that's kind of sad
sw02051-A_050515-050648 uh-huh
sw02051-A_052033-052178 yeah
sw02051-A_053564-053715 um-hum

sw02051-B_000452-000583 right
sw02051-B_000947-001067 where is that
sw02051-B_001449-001640 north south east or west
sw02051-B_001799-002015 well you live almost in oklahoma
sw02051-B_002265-002726 yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from oklahoma either
sw02051-B_002726-002972 you know where saint joe is
sw02051-B_003181-003400 i'm about eight miles south of it
sw02051-B_004748-004927 well you know
sw02051-B_005036-005391 i've i've seen those statistics and everything
sw02051-B_005391-005595 and you know what frightens me
sw02051-B_005595-006039 is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert
sw02051-B_006039-006296 with high tech weaponry
sw02051-B_006398-006536 you know i mean
sw02051-B_006536-007165 the iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that
sw02051-B_007165-007431 and they didn't kill as many people in
sw02051-B_007431-007687 in forty five days
sw02051-B_007687-008034 and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job
sw02051-B_008034-008315 as they killed in washington d._c.
sw02051-B_009487-009607 well
sw02051-B_009607-009945 i formulated a pretty radical theory
sw02051-B_009945-010337 over the last ten years i guess
sw02051-B_010337-010474 and
sw02051-B_010474-010690 i've come to the conclusion
sw02051-B_010791-010924 and this is [vocalized-noise]
sw02051-B_011037-011284 a pretty scary thought to me even
sw02051-B_011284-011729 that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime
sw02051-B_011729-012138 rather than put them in prison because prison's proven not to work
sw02051-B_012138-012276 just let them go
sw02051-B_012402-012611 say okay you're convicted
sw02051-B_012611-012833 and just let them go
sw02051-B_012833-013102 and if they get convicted again
sw02051-B_013229-013377 well just kill them
sw02051-B_013938-014182 well i think that
sw02051-B_014182-014406 the best hope
sw02051-B_014406-014586 to eliminate
sw02051-B_014586-014722 crime
sw02051-B_014722-014916 as we know it today
sw02051-B_014916-015186 is to eliminate the criminals from society
sw02051-B_015291-015732 if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job
sw02051-B_015732-016166 you know they can't be accepted into society
sw02051-B_016166-016669 you know if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic
sw02051-B_016770-017166 and you know who's to put the limit on it
sw02051-B_017166-017604 i mean i was watching a thing last night up in washington state
sw02051-B_017604-017849 if you get convicted of uh
sw02051-B_017953-018109 sexual offenses
sw02051-B_018212-018718 on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions
sw02051-B_018718-019093 and they're still let out on the street after one or two years
sw02051-B_019093-019553 well in washington state if you're a habitual sexual offender
sw02051-B_019655-019811 they just don't let you out
sw02051-B_019960-020202 uh you serve your prison term
sw02051-B_020202-020710 and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go
sw02051-B_020710-020848 well
sw02051-B_020986-021370 they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now
sw02051-B_021370-022508 you know
sw02051-B_022508-022697 hey people make mistakes
sw02051-B_023451-023603 well
sw02051-B_023603-024542 yeah use that or you know there's other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
sw02051-B_024670-024797 you know
sw02051-B_024797-025327 at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against
sw02051-B_025327-026016 feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them
sw02051-B_026138-026798 but uh you know with the tech- technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg
sw02051-B_026798-027144 that will knock him down if they leave the property
sw02051-B_027257-027463 i mean it will just in incapacitate them
sw02051-B_027583-027869 and you can put a collar around a guys leg
sw02051-B_027869-028051 that will
sw02051-B_028051-028261 prohibit them
sw02051-B_028261-028504 from committing any kind of
sw02051-B_028504-028658 you know prohibitive act
sw02051-B_028763-029145 but you know putting them in prison my god that doesn't work
sw02051-B_029710-029937 well you look at places like turkey
sw02051-B_030048-030427 turkey has death penalty for just about everything
sw02051-B_030427-030575 i mean if you get
sw02051-B_030676-031187 convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you
sw02051-B_031187-031452 you get convicted of uh
sw02051-B_031452-031717 you know uh heinous crimes
sw02051-B_031717-032062 they just kill you i mean there's no two ways about it
sw02051-B_032062-032296 and uh
sw02051-B_032296-032775 you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few
sw02051-B_032948-033195 you know and you look at our society
sw02051-B_033195-033524 almost everyone out on the street
sw02051-B_033524-033992 that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times
sw02051-B_033992-034180 right i mean you know
sw02051-B_034326-034666 you know the way to stop that kind of behavior
sw02051-B_034771-034978 is this two fold
sw02051-B_034978-035107 one
sw02051-B_035224-035488 you need to make it illegal for
sw02051-B_035488-035808 both parents to work while the kids are under seven
sw02051-B_036004-036200 i- i think that's very important
sw02051-B_036459-036621 and then
sw02051-B_036792-037206 if a parent has proved to be unfit
sw02051-B_037206-037385 for any reason
sw02051-B_037521-037828 take the kids away from the parents
sw02051-B_037828-037993 because
sw02051-B_037993-038239 you know we are what we teach
sw02051-B_038239-038796 because that's what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people
sw02051-B_038796-039627 and i've and i've i've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work
sw02051-B_039627-040102 you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone
sw02051-B_040102-040477 i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building
sw02051-B_040477-041156 and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs
sw02051-B_041156-041874 and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on monday
sw02051-B_041996-042286 and the kids of these people
sw02051-B_042412-042686 are phenomenally
sw02051-B_042686-042887 they're sociopathic
sw02051-B_042887-043272 and i worked in a first grade uh classroom
sw02051-B_043272-043484 for one full semester
sw02051-B_043638-044066 and these kids were more foul mouthed than i've ever been
sw02051-B_044066-044406 i had one kid threaten my life first grader
sw02051-B_044406-044755 threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death
sw02051-B_044874-045218 you know and they flipping me the finger and all that
sw02051-B_045218-045937 and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die
sw02051-B_045937-046236 because you will eventually be killed
sw02051-B_046236-046893 and [vocalized-noise] you know i just i'm just totally a- aghast at a what's going on
sw02051-B_046893-048956 um-hum
sw02051-B_048956-049077 exactly
sw02051-B_049558-049806 well you can see it in the work place
sw02051-B_049806-049951 you know
sw02051-B_049951-050162 used to be when you had a
sw02051-B_050162-050599 personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it
sw02051-B_050599-050766 now
sw02051-B_050766-050963 you know people get fired
sw02051-B_051101-051242 or
sw02051-B_051242-051375 [laughter]
sw02051-B_051375-052107 what's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired
sw02051-B_052107-052750 or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the japanese
sw02051-B_052857-052978 you put
sw02051-B_052978-053411 that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together
sw02051-B_053411-053716 okay it's in their culture
sw02051-B_053716-054879 and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while japan was becoming a great power financially
sw02051-B_054879-055232 the people that worked for those companies
sw02051-B_055232-055787 worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen
sw02051-B_055787-056486 and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people
sw02051-B_056486-056905 if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them
sw02051-B_057030-057331 they made a position for them some where
sw02051-B_057331-057786 uh you look at uh frito lay my wife used to work for frito lay
sw02051-B_057786-058007 as a typist
sw02051-B_058007-058379 you know transcribing stuff into the computer
sw02051-B_058379-058755 well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute
sw02051-B_058755-058908 but she don't like it
sw02051-B_059094-059388 she she just doesn't like to do that i mean she will
sw02051-B_059388-060068 but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
sw02053-A_000111-000360 um what kind of hobbies do you have
sw02053-A_000591-000873 really i like cross-stitch too
