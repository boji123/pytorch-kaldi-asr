sw02039-A_035800-035932 uh
sw02039-A_035932-036070 i think
sw02039-A_036070-036473 what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of
sw02039-A_036473-036664 historical truth
sw02039-A_036792-037075 but the interpretation that
sw02039-A_037075-037336 actually got into the um
sw02039-A_037336-037725 the writing of the bible itself is probably
sw02039-A_038446-038595 uh
sw02039-A_043463-043692 fact involved just from the
sw02039-A_043692-044166 uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available
sw02039-A_044871-045321 you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that
sw02039-A_045321-045725 it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way
sw02039-A_047852-048298 i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh

sw02040-A_013073-013222 uh
sw02040-A_014257-014632 well probably more on in terms of the u._s.
sw02040-A_014632-014791 um
sw02040-A_014791-015205 you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the u._s. copes
sw02040-A_015205-015644 with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so
sw02040-A_016391-016640 the press as i w- you know
sw02040-A_017268-017705 new state that is so very very poor
sw02040-A_020399-020584 i think so
sw02040-A_022248-022412 um-hum
sw02040-A_030480-030617 um
sw02040-A_030617-031000 i don't know wh- uh i suppose
sw02040-A_031000-031344 they also not being a state are
sw02040-A_031344-031719 probably freer to determine their own
sw02040-A_031719-032161 um ways of life than they would if if
sw02040-A_032874-033151 perhaps compulsory education
sw02040-A_033315-033458 um
sw02040-A_033458-033710 and taxes [laughter]
sw02040-A_039694-040032 so if they've just taken such action
sw02040-A_040799-041142 to declare this before they become a state
sw02040-A_042775-043178 i i believe i would probably tend towards that
sw02040-A_044494-044679 well that's interesting
sw02040-A_045752-046025 as a condition for statehood
sw02040-A_048892-049027 um-hum
sw02040-A_050523-050661 um
sw02040-A_052695-052880 um-hum um-hum
sw02040-A_052996-053198 that's interesting because
sw02040-A_053198-053669 although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience
sw02040-A_053669-053848 uh
sw02040-A_053848-054337 i was in bilingual education in california and
sw02040-A_054337-054653 i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
sw02040-A_054653-055052 my brother wh- who was uh quite a bit younger
sw02040-A_055052-055513 was learning spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
sw02040-A_055513-055896 and so obviously it didn't work in california
sw02040-A_056094-056231 right
sw02040-A_056669-056799 right
sw02040-A_057332-057531 oh i see

sw02051-B_001449-001640 north south east or west
sw02051-B_001799-002015 well you live almost in oklahoma
sw02051-B_002265-002726 yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from oklahoma either
sw02051-B_002726-002972 you know where saint joe is
sw02051-B_003181-003400 i'm about eight miles south of it
sw02051-B_004748-004927 well you know
sw02051-B_005036-005391 i've i've seen those statistics and everything
sw02051-B_005391-005595 and you know what frightens me
sw02051-B_005595-006039 is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert
sw02051-B_006039-006296 with high tech weaponry
sw02051-B_006398-006536 you know i mean
sw02051-B_007165-007431 and they didn't kill as many people in
sw02051-B_007431-007687 in forty five days
sw02051-B_007687-008034 and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job
sw02051-B_008034-008315 as they killed in washington d._c.
sw02051-B_009487-009607 well
sw02051-B_009607-009945 i formulated a pretty radical theory
sw02051-B_009945-010337 over the last ten years i guess
sw02051-B_010337-010474 and
sw02051-B_010474-010690 i've come to the conclusion
sw02051-B_010791-010924 and this is [vocalized-noise]
sw02051-B_011037-011284 a pretty scary thought to me even
sw02051-B_011284-011729 that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime
sw02051-B_011729-012138 rather than put them in prison because prison's proven not to work
sw02051-B_012138-012276 just let them go
sw02051-B_012402-012611 say okay you're convicted
sw02051-B_012611-012833 and just let them go
sw02051-B_012833-013102 and if they get convicted again
sw02051-B_013229-013377 well just kill them
sw02051-B_013938-014182 well i think that
sw02051-B_014182-014406 the best hope
sw02051-B_014406-014586 to eliminate
sw02051-B_014586-014722 crime
sw02051-B_014722-014916 as we know it today
sw02051-B_014916-015186 is to eliminate the criminals from society
sw02051-B_015291-015732 if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job
sw02051-B_015732-016166 you know they can't be accepted into society
sw02051-B_016770-017166 and you know who's to put the limit on it
sw02051-B_017166-017604 i mean i was watching a thing last night up in washington state
sw02051-B_017604-017849 if you get convicted of uh
sw02051-B_017953-018109 sexual offenses
sw02051-B_018718-019093 and they're still let out on the street after one or two years
sw02051-B_019093-019553 well in washington state if you're a habitual sexual offender
sw02051-B_019655-019811 they just don't let you out
sw02051-B_019960-020202 uh you serve your prison term
sw02051-B_020710-020848 well
sw02051-B_020986-021370 they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now
sw02051-B_022508-022697 hey people make mistakes
sw02051-B_023451-023603 well
sw02051-B_024670-024797 you know
sw02051-B_026798-027144 that will knock him down if they leave the property
sw02051-B_027257-027463 i mean it will just in incapacitate them
sw02051-B_027583-027869 and you can put a collar around a guys leg
sw02051-B_027869-028051 that will
sw02051-B_028051-028261 prohibit them
sw02051-B_028261-028504 from committing any kind of
sw02051-B_028504-028658 you know prohibitive act
sw02051-B_028763-029145 but you know putting them in prison my god that doesn't work
sw02051-B_029710-029937 well you look at places like turkey
sw02051-B_030048-030427 turkey has death penalty for just about everything
sw02051-B_030427-030575 i mean if you get
sw02051-B_031187-031452 you get convicted of uh
sw02051-B_031452-031717 you know uh heinous crimes
sw02051-B_031717-032062 they just kill you i mean there's no two ways about it
sw02051-B_032062-032296 and uh
sw02051-B_032296-032775 you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few
sw02051-B_032948-033195 you know and you look at our society
sw02051-B_033195-033524 almost everyone out on the street
sw02051-B_033524-033992 that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times
sw02051-B_033992-034180 right i mean you know
sw02051-B_034326-034666 you know the way to stop that kind of behavior
sw02051-B_034771-034978 is this two fold
sw02051-B_034978-035107 one
sw02051-B_035224-035488 you need to make it illegal for
sw02051-B_035488-035808 both parents to work while the kids are under seven
sw02051-B_036004-036200 i- i think that's very important
sw02051-B_036459-036621 and then
sw02051-B_036792-037206 if a parent has proved to be unfit
sw02051-B_037206-037385 for any reason
sw02051-B_037521-037828 take the kids away from the parents
sw02051-B_037828-037993 because
sw02051-B_037993-038239 you know we are what we teach
sw02051-B_039627-040102 you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone
sw02051-B_040102-040477 i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building
sw02051-B_041996-042286 and the kids of these people
sw02051-B_042412-042686 are phenomenally
sw02051-B_042686-042887 they're sociopathic
sw02051-B_042887-043272 and i worked in a first grade uh classroom
sw02051-B_043272-043484 for one full semester
sw02051-B_043638-044066 and these kids were more foul mouthed than i've ever been
sw02051-B_044066-044406 i had one kid threaten my life first grader
sw02051-B_044406-044755 threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death
sw02051-B_044874-045218 you know and they flipping me the finger and all that
sw02051-B_045937-046236 because you will eventually be killed
sw02051-B_048956-049077 exactly
sw02051-B_049558-049806 well you can see it in the work place
sw02051-B_049806-049951 you know
sw02051-B_049951-050162 used to be when you had a
sw02051-B_050162-050599 personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it
sw02051-B_050599-050766 now
sw02051-B_050766-050963 you know people get fired
sw02051-B_051101-051242 or
sw02051-B_051242-051375 [laughter]
sw02051-B_052857-052978 you put
sw02051-B_052978-053411 that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together
sw02051-B_053411-053716 okay it's in their culture
sw02051-B_054879-055232 the people that worked for those companies
